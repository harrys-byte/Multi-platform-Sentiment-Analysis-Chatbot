india,week,The recent problems in Mumbai based on language have been manufactured by BJP & MNS to increase their vote share in upcoming BMC elections. Common people are not involved in this much.,"Municipality elections are supposed to take place in Maharashtra later in the year. BJP really wants to win the Mumbai's BMC to strengthen hold on Mumbai and finish off Thackeray group. Their internal surveys must have indicated that it will be difficult to defeat Thackeray sena in Mumbai even with the help of Shinde sena or MNS. So, they have gone back to their formula of divide & conquer.

BJP govt tried to introduce new rule to impose Hindi language study from 1st standard. this faced a lot of resistance & outcry in Maharashtra from different parts of society. MNS jumped on this opportunity to showcase themselves as Marathi cause Warriors. Raj Thackeray threatened agitation against govt and later MNS workers started their aggressive confrontations against People who dont speak marathi. Common people are not part of these aggressive incidents, its MNS workers mostly.

Now, Mumbai  has 50-50 population of marathi & non-marathi speakers. BJP plans to consolidates non-marathi voters and then snatch some marathi voteshare as well with Hindutva agenda and distributing money and voter fraud of course. They used the same strategy in haryana by consolidating non-jaat votes and in Maharashtra state elections by consolidating non-maratha caste votes. 

MNS won 0 zero seats in state elections. So no wonder they see this as a good opportunity to increase their vote share, win some seats and then play king maker in BMC. I in fact think Raj Thackeray & BJP CM Fadnavis might have even discussed such strategy when they met twice at least  this year as reported below.

Bihari MP Nishikant dubey recently made comments asking what is Marathi people achieved in maharashtra ? How many business are run by maharashtrian people etc. He claimed that business in maharashtra are successful due to north indian workers working there and ores in bihar producing minerals. Now why is a bihari MP making comments about maharashtra and marathi people now ? cause, BJP also plans to use this image of saviors of non-marathi speakers in upcoming Bihar elections.

So, BJP & MNS will keep milking this marathi vs non-marathi issue until elections are done. Unfortunately, both shivsena factions are being dragged along the 2 sides. thackeray sena cannot lose marathi voters. shinde sena cannot leave BJP. So they have to stick to each side even if mildly. NCP facyions & Congress havent taken any stance. they seem to have given up on Mumbai for now.

News media & social have also bought into this battle fully. both make it look like this is a big issue and something is happening every day. But I assure you this not the case. I and many other do think that People living in maharashtra shoud have some basic knowledge of conversing in marathi.  But going around beating up people is not something people agree on. But the absolute arrogance of some people towards marathi language does turn off many marathi people. But things are not as bad here as they are made out to be. This is mostly politicians creating issues for their own benefits.

india,month,Why Are Some Right-Wing Indians Celebrating Israel’s Attacks on Iran Despite Clear Racism Toward Indians?,"I’ve been watching the online reactions to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, and what’s baffling is how enthusiastically some right-wing Indians are cheering for Israel. It’s almost bizarre how emotionally invested they seem in a country that has very openly discriminated against Indians both at the state level and among the general public.

Let’s be honest:
1. Indians have been called “dirty” or “unwelcome” by segments of Israeli society.

2. Many Indian workers, particularly caregivers and construction laborers, have faced blatant racism and abuse.


3. There are well-documented cases of Indian Jews in Israel facing casteism-like treatment or being seen as “less Jewish” than European Jews.

Yet here we are; watching keyboard warriors from India call Israel “our brother,” “a strong nation,” and even wishing India would “learn from Israel” when it comes to foreign policy or military action. Why? Because Iran is seen as a Muslim-majority enemy, and in their black-and-white worldview, that’s enough reason to side with Israel?

It’s strange how easily they ignore how Israelis often don’t even want us there; except maybe as cheap labor or expendable manpower. They overlook the fact that supporting Israel blindly just because it opposes certain Muslim nations doesn’t make geopolitical sense. It just shows how deeply communalism and performative nationalism have hijacked their thinking.

What exactly do these people get out of it?
Is it just a desperate need to feel aligned with a “powerful ally”? Or is it simply another outlet for their Islamophobia, even if it means cosigning a state that would turn them away at the airport?

It’s one thing to understand geopolitical alliances based on interest, but this blind emotional support, especially from people who will never be accepted by those they admire, is honestly just sad and embarrassing.",842,555,2025-06-18,tychoofficial,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1lecpyw/why_are_some_rightwing_indians_celebrating/,why are some rightwing indians celebrating israels attacks on iran despite clear racism toward indians,ive been watching the online reactions to the ongoing conflict between israel and iran and whats baffling is how enthusiastically some rightwing indians are cheering for israel its almost bizarre how emotionally invested they seem in a country that has very openly discriminated against indians both at the state level and among the general public lets be honest indians have been called dirty or unwelcome by segments of israeli society many indian workers particularly caregivers and construction laborers have faced blatant racism and abuse there are welldocumented cases of indian jews in israel facing casteismlike treatment or being seen as less jewish than european jews yet here we are watching keyboard warriors from india call israel our brother a strong nation and even wishing india would learn from israel when it comes to foreign policy or military action why because iran is seen as a muslimmajority enemy and in their blackandwhite worldview thats enough reason to side with israel its strange how easily they ignore how israelis often dont even want us there except maybe as cheap labor or expendable manpower they overlook the fact that supporting israel blindly just because it opposes certain muslim nations doesnt make geopolitical sense it just shows how deeply communalism and performative nationalism have hijacked their thinking what exactly do these people get out of it is it just a desperate need to feel aligned with a powerful ally or is it simply another outlet for their islamophobia even if it means cosigning a state that would turn them away at the airport its one thing to understand geopolitical alliances based on interest but this blind emotional support especially from people who will never be accepted by those they admire is honestly just sad and embarrassing,rightwing indians celebrating israels attacks iran despite clear racism toward indians,ive watching online reactions ongoing conflict israel iran whats baffling enthusiastically rightwing indians cheering israel almost bizarre emotionally invested seem country openly discriminated indians state level among general public lets honest indians called dirty unwelcome segments israeli society many indian workers particularly caregivers construction laborers faced blatant racism abuse welldocumented cases indian jews israel facing casteismlike treatment seen less jewish european jews yet watching keyboard warriors india call israel brother strong nation even wishing india would learn israel comes foreign policy military action iran seen muslimmajority enemy blackandwhite worldview thats enough reason side israel strange easily ignore israelis often dont even want us except maybe cheap labor expendable manpower overlook fact supporting israel blindly opposes certain muslim nations doesnt make geopolitical sense shows deeply communalism performative nationalism hijacked thinking exactly people get desperate need feel aligned powerful ally simply another outlet islamophobia even means cosigning state would turn away airport one thing understand geopolitical alliances based interest blind emotional support especially people never accepted admire honestly sad embarrassing,False,-0.8943142294883728,Negative,Real Text
india,month,Does Hindi Unite or Divide India? A Reality Check !,"**Let's Look at history which shows u what happens when a certain policy takes place**

# Pre-2024 (Before NEP 2020 Push):

India, despite its diversity, remained largely united.

Yes, there were internal state disputes (e.g., Tamil Nadu vs Karnataka over Cauvery), but these were isolated bilateral issues, not pan-regional unrest.

Importantly, southern states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, and Maharashtra may have differed politically, but they did not display a collective resistance against the Centre over anything big.

The overall national atmosphere was one of diversity and unity.

# Post-2024 (NEP 2020 Implementation Phase):

The push for Hindi-centric education and administration under NEP 2020 triggered strong, coordinated opposition from southern states.

The emphasis on Hindi was perceived as:

A cultural imposition, A threat to regional languages and federal autonomy.

>*^(For the first time in decades, multiple southern states found a common cause to resist the Centre — not over water, not over finance, but over language identity.)*

Let's Look at States and their reaction when hindi was pushed one way or the other

# Tamil Nadu

1937 – Compulsory Hindi in Schools--Rajaji’s Congress govt introduced compulsory Hindi in Madras Presidency schools.

Protests Led by Periyar & the Justice Party. Early Dravidian mobilization. A strong messaging on “Tamil self-respect” was started and set the ideological foundation for future anti-Hindi movements.

1965 – Official Language Act Implementation -- Centre’s move to make Hindi the sole official language (replacing English).

Protests erupted, Massive, violent agitations by students & public across Tamil Nadu, **with many sacrificing their lives.** “*Hindi theriyathu poda*” — “*I don’t know Hindi, get lost*” Became a cultural resistance symbol.

this eventually led to constitutional amendment; English retained as associate official language.

# Karnataka

2017 – Namma Metro Signage Controversy--Hindi signs in Bengaluru Metro alongside Kannada & English citizens launched #NammaMetroHindiBeda (No Hindi in Our Metro) campaign and Hindi signage was removed.

# West Bengal

2018–2023 – Central Exams, NEP Push; Hindi dominance in UPSC, central education bodies, and NEP 2020. Strong political and intellectual opposition was triggered. CM Mamata Banerjee said “We have no problem with Hindi, but don’t impose it. Bengal reiterated its stand on Bengali-first education & governance.

# North-East States

2020–2022 – NEP 2020 Push--NEP 2020 push to introduce Hindi in schools and administrative roles. No public agitations but instead, governments officially requested exemption. Demonstrating passive resistance and continued preference for English & native tribal languages.

# Maharashtra

Ongoing – Cultural and Media Space due to Hindi dominance in media, film industry, and central hiring. Raj Thackeray (MNS) and others have launched campaigns demanding Marathi priority.“Marathi Mansa First” – “Marathi people come first.” Growing movement to protect Marathi in public spaces and employment against Hindi

# Punjab

1950s–Present – Post-Partition Linguistic Assertion, Resistance to Hindi being treated as default Indian identity after Partition. Political movements emphasizing Punjabi language rights. Punjabi retained as official language, strong assertion in education & administration.

# History speaks louder than slogans.

Every time Hindi has been pushed, India has seen resistance — sometimes silent, sometimes violent. From Tamil Nadu’s mass protests in 1965 to civil disobedience in Karnataka and passive objections from the North-East, the pattern is clear:

***Imposition breeds division and hatred***

But when Hindi is not forced, Indian states have remained **united, cooperative, and supportive** of the Centre.

>***From Independence till today, India has stood strong without a common language, now India is divided because we push for a common language***

People often say, “*One language will unite us.*” But history tells another story:

>***It is only when Hindi is pushed that India fractures.***

So perhaps the truth is this:

>***Hindi doesn’t unite us — it divides us. And those who push it, knowingly or unknowingly, divide India. Jai Hind !***

india,month,Has anyone installed solar panels plus battery for their apartment buildings?,"Hey r/india!

I’ve been researching solar panels for apartment buildings and wondering if anyone here has actually installed them? With rising electricity costs across the country and the PM Surya Ghar scheme, it seems like a good time to explore this.

**What I found so far:**

*The Numbers (example for 3kW system):*

- Total cost: ₹1,90,000 - ₹2,15,000 (varies by city/state)
- Central Government subsidy: ₹78,000 (PM Surya Ghar scheme)
- **Net cost after subsidy: ₹1,12,000 - ₹1,37,000**
- For a 3-apartment building: ₹37,000 - ₹45,000 per flat
- Monthly savings: ₹1,500 - ₹3,000 per apartment (depends on local electricity rates)
- Payback time: 18-30 months

*The Process:*

1. Apply on pmsuryaghar.gov.in
1. Wait for local DISCOM approval (supposed to be 15 days)
1. Choose empanelled vendor from your state
1. Installation takes 3-5 days
1. Get subsidy in bank account within 30 days

**What seems universal:**

- Net metering available across most states
- No special building permissions needed in most places
- Works for individual houses, apartment complexes, housing societies
- Helps India reduce coal dependency and meet renewable energy targets
- Property values reportedly increase 10-15%

**My questions for anyone who’s done this:**

1. **Which state/city are you in** and how was your experience?
1. **State-specific subsidies?** Some states offer additional incentives
1. **DISCOM cooperation?** How helpful was your local electricity board?
1. **Actual vs projected savings?** Did you really save what they promised?
1. **Apartment building logistics?** How did you handle cost-sharing, maintenance agreements?
1. **Battery backup?** Worth the extra cost or stick to grid-tied?
1. **Vendor experiences?** Any recommendations or companies to avoid?
1. **Monsoon performance?** How much does generation drop during rainy season?

**My concerns:**

- **State variations**: Each state seems to have different policies and DISCOMs
- **Building society approvals**: Getting all residents to agree and contribute
- **Long-term maintenance**: Who’s responsible after warranty expires?
- **Technology changes**: Will better/cheaper tech make current investment obsolete?
- **Moving**: How does investment recovery work if you sell/move?

**Why I’m considering this:**

Beyond the financial benefits, India’s pushing hard for renewable energy targets and reducing coal dependence. Plus with climate change and rising energy costs, seems like a good hedge for the future.

**Looking for real experiences from across India:**

- Which states have the best additional incentives?
- Any horror stories with installations or vendors?
- Tips for convincing apartment societies/neighbors?
- How’s the actual performance vs promises?

Also curious about different building types - individual houses, small apartments, large complexes. What works best?

Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences!

india,month,Notebandi (demonetization of banknotes) to Vote-bandi (disenfranchisement of voters): Clueless Policies Inflicting Endless Pain On Ordinary Citizens,"On 24 June, the Election Commission of India released an instruction for Special Intensive Revision of Electoral Roll in Bihar, a state which is scheduled to go to polls in four-months. With this exercise, the EC would force 8 crore voters in Bihar to re-register for the voter list and prove their citizenship, within the span of one month.

According to the [instruction released by the EC on June 22](https://www.eci.gov.in/eci-backend/public/api/download?url=LMAhAK6sOPBp%2FNFF0iRfXbEB1EVSLT41NNLRjYNJJP1KivrUxbfqkDatmHy12e%2FzIv7%2FZQ09etPKoyJV5h%2FcTpSBy2rLSWcB8ZqM9aI5KyrxL4EAnNdah6vWMkIUyW8NsXQUwCbGU493NshNTgs7UQ%3D%3D):
1. All the 8 crore voters need to fill the enumeration form by 25 July.
2. Among the voters, who were not in the 2003 voters list (4.76 crore voters)
   1. Those born before 1987, need to provide their own documents. 
   2. Those born between 1987 and 2004, need to provide their own and one of their parent’s documents.
   3. Those born after 2004, need to provide their own and both their parents’ documents.

These 4.76 crore voters need to provide their own and/or their parents’ documents from the 11 documents approved by the EC for this process --- birth certificate, matriculation certificate, caste certificate, residential certificate, land allotment certificate, forest right certificate, family register, passport, pension order, government ID card, and NRC. According to an [article by Dr Rahul Shastri](https://www.thehindu.com/data/voter-verification-drive-in-bihar-too-little-time-too-many-hurdles/article69756972.ece), half of the population of Bihar do not possess any of these certificates.

The notification for Special Intensive Revision has thrown the people into chaos. Till date, the EC has not been able to even distribute the forms. The people who have received the forms are unable to even read it, let alone find the required documents. A large population of Bihar lives as migrants in different states and countries. Many do not even have a clue about the process, which is set to end in 20 days.

[In village after village in Bihar, a chorus: ‘We only have Aadhaar… how do we get the papers EC asking for?’](https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/village-bihar-chorus-only-have-aadhaar-how-do-we-get-papers-ec-asking-10105205/)

[Confusion reigns as Bihar’s Special Intensive Revision of rolls gets underway - The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bihar/reality-check-many-bihar-voters-cannot-read-special-intensive-revision-forms-do-not-have-any-documents-listed-by-eci/article69760627.ece)

It is worth noting that the election commission conducts regular summary revision exercises, the last one in January 2025. The last intensive revision exercise was conducted in 2003, a year before general elections. Meanwhile, the 2025 Special Intensive Revision exercise, is to be completed in a month, and less than four months before the elections. Even the census exercise, which is self-reporting, and does not require any documents, require several months. 

Meanwhile, facing criticism and protests, the election commission started changing its aims and rules, day after day. On 30 June, [it released another notification](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2140722), stating that the children of the voters whose name is in the 2003 voters list, need not submit their parents’ documents. On 6 July, after the [exercise was challenged in the Supreme Court](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ngo-moves-supreme-court-challenging-ecis-special-intensive-revision-of-rolls-in-bihar/article69775809.ece), [an advertisement published by the election commission](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bihar/major-relief-to-voters-ec-makes-big-decision-on-documents/article69779542.ece) said that the voters can submit their enumeration form, even without documents.

**The shifting narratives of the Special Intensive Revision exercise, is eerily similar to the Modi Government’s changing narratives during the demonetization exercise, which had caused innumerable suffering to the people and the economy, with none of the claimed achievements.**

**The question is why these senseless policies are imposed on the people, without proper consultation or even a plan. The Government has turned the nation into a laboratory for experiments, with one after another mindless decisions.**

The real reason is that the Government wants to raise the bogey of infiltrators and illegal immigrants, like it did in the Jharkhand election. This subject will be discussed in another post.

india,month,"June 26, 1975 Emergency: 50 Years Later, Are We Safe from Another One?","The following excerpt is drawn from ***India: The Definitive History*** by Professor Damodar R. SarDesai, an esteemed Indian-American historian and Professor Emeritus of History at UCLA, who passed away in 2016. Renowned for his authoritative works on South and Southeast Asian history, including *Southeast Asia: Past and Present*, SarDesai held prestigious roles such as Chair of UCLA’s History Department and the first Doshi Chair in Pre-Modern Indian History. This passage, detailing the Emergency declared on June 26, 1975, under Indira Gandhi’s leadership, examines the economic crises, political unrest, and judicial challenges that led to the suspension of fundamental rights, offering a critical perspective on this pivotal moment in India’s democratic history.

**Citation**: SarDesai, D. R. *India: The Definitive History*. Routledge, 2018, pp. 343–348.

**THE EMERGENCY**

The huge costs of maintaining an estimated 10 million refugees from East Pakistan, who crossed the border into India’s West Bengal, and the costs of the Bangladesh war and for maintaining the 93,000 prisoners of war as prescribed by the relevant Geneva Conventions grossly affected India’s economic situation. Additionally, the two years following that war were marked by crop failures affecting the price levels of essential commodities. Internationally, the world oil prices tripled following the Egypt-Israel War in 1973, affecting the costs of industrial products, again adversely affecting the cost of living. For the masses, the pride and glory of winning the Bangladesh war and partitioning Pakistan gave way to the frustration of balancing the pocketbook in trying to meet the family’s expenses. There were numerous strikes, the worst being that of the railroad employees.

*Discontent and J. P.’s Total Revolution*

The public discontent over the spiraling inflation, unemployment, and mounting corruption was channeled in two states—Bihar and Gujarat—into mass movements. In the latter state, students led the agitation and forced the Congress-led government to resign in 1974. In the following year, the Congress Party was trounced at the polls in Gujarat in June, and the opposition parties came together to form a government there. In both the states, the activists took inspiration and guidance from Jaiprakash Narayan, popularly known as J. P., the nationally known Gandhian Sarvodaya leader who led the public discontent and advocated a civil disobedience movement, reminding people of the Gandhian movement by that name against the alien, colonial British regime four decades before. If the Bangladesh war had raised Indira’s personal stature to unprecedented levels, J. P.’s movement, called the Total Revolution, made Indira and her acolytes run for succor. The movement influenced the defeat of her party in the Gujarat elections in June 1975 as a multiparty coalition, the Janata Morcha (People’s March) Party, won the majority of seats in the state assembly.

*Allahabad Court Judgment Against Indira’s Electoral Violations*

The final straw that broke the proverbial camel’s back came in the form of a writ issued by Justice J. M. L. Sinha of the Allahabad High Court on June 12, 1975, declaring Indira’s election to the parliament in 1971 invalid on the grounds that she had violated the election rules. She had appointed as her election agent one Yashpal Kapoor, who was during part of that period on the government payroll in the PMO. She had also benefited from the UP state government’s free construction of a speakers’ rostrum and free electricity supply to her public address system during her election campaign. The judgment concerned a case filed by her opponent in that election, Raj Narain of the Samajwadi Socialist Party. Indira’s infractions were petty, but the Representation of the People Act demanded that all violations, small or large, not only rendered the offender’s election invalid but would also make the individual ineligible to hold public office for six years. Two chief ministers of states and a member of Indira’s cabinet had previously been sanctioned in the same manner. Justice Sinha gave the Congress Parliamentary Party twenty days to elect a new leader for the position of the country’s prime minister.

It was the first bad news for Indira and her party on June 12. That evening came the news of the Congress Party’s defeat in the Gujarat state elections, where out of 182 seats, her party had won only 75. The Congress Party appealed to the Supreme Court of India for an “absolute and unconditional” stay order against the Allahabad High Court judgment. It was a tribute to the Indian judicial system that on June 24, 1975, Justice V. R. Krishna Iyer of the Supreme Court, going strictly by the letter of the law, denied a stay order, thereby closing all legal options for Indira, who was then expected to resign. On the same day, at a massive rally in Delhi, the opposition parties under J. P.’s leadership announced that they would launch a civil disobedience movement throughout the country if Indira continued as prime minister. J. P. went further and appealed to the army and the police not to obey any illegal orders even if they were issued by the prime minister.

*Proclamation of “Emergency”*

Should Indira have resigned? If she had, it was most likely that the Congress Party would have picked as her successor a weak and pliable person, who in his or her capacity as prime minister, could be depended on to recommend to the president that he set aside the Allahabad High Court judgment and pardon her. But feeling insecure, the Indira Gandhi government issued an ordinance in the early hours of the fateful June 26, 1975 (after waking up President Fakhruddin Ahmed to obtain his signature), declaring a national emergency under the provisions of Part 18 of the Constitution. The ordinance said that “a grave emergency exists whereby the security of India is threatened by internal disturbances,” justifying the suspension of fundamental rights. Using her majority in the parliament, Indira proceeded to amend the constitution, exonerating her from all culpability. In predawn raids across the country, some 676 members of the opposition parties, including 59 members of the parliament and including the venerable J. P. and political leaders of stature who had rendered long-term public service such as Morarji Desai, were arrested under the hated Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA), without the benefit of habeas corpus or a court trial. Women leaders such as the Maharani of Jaipur, Rajmata of Gwalior, and Mrinal Gore were closeted in the same wards as some mentally deranged criminals, whose shrieks and cries would not allow them to sleep. As for J. P., he contracted renal disease while in detention and had no access to dialysis. Most of the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Jan Sangh (later Bharatiya Janata Party \[BJP\]) members, including the future prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, were jailed. Within a week of the ordinance, on July 4, twenty-six political organizations, including the RSS, were declared illegal.

Indira’s Emergency Government also imposed a strict censorship of the press and the media. On the day of the massive arrests of opposition leaders, the supply of electricity to all major newspapers in the capital was cut off so that they would not be able to publish the news of the arrests. The press protested for days by leaving the editorial space blank, sometimes bordered black. Even the mildest criticism was not permitted by the censors. Newspapers that even subtly criticized government actions were denied government advertising, which was and is an important revenue source for Indian newspapers. Several journalists managed to smuggle bits of information to the foreign press, which regularly reported Indira’s excesses and the constitutional amendments that had lent legality to her ignoble actions.

Indira then proceeded to “legalize” her own position in the context of the Allahabad High Court judgment. Thus, at her behest, the parliament adopted the Thirty-ninth Amendment to the constitution in August 1975, placing elections to certain positions—president, vice president, prime minister, and speaker of the Lok Sabha—beyond challenge in a court of law and also beyond the pale of judicial review. The amendment, retroactive in its application, nullified the Allahabad High Court judgment. As if this was not enough, the Allahabad judgment was submitted to the Supreme Court, which ruled on November 7, 1975, that the judgment be “set aside.”

It was widely reported that in imposing a national emergency, Indira acted on the advice of her younger son, Sanjay. He was also her principal adviser throughout the period of the emergency, which lasted nineteen months, from June 25, 1975, to January 18, 1977. Even while Nehru was the country’s prime minister, Indira had to approach him if something could be done to help Sanjay, who had been arrested by the police for reportedly being involved with an automobile-stealing gang in Delhi. While in Great Britain as an apprentice at Roll-Royce, he was arrested for fast driving and other demeanors; he had to be bailed out by the Indian High Commission. Over the years, he had built a reputation for behaving as if he was above the law. During the emergency, he came to be known for “getting things done” in the public interest and also for personal favors to well-placed businessmen and industrialists, securing them permits and additional quotas in return for funds for the party. There was no knowing whether he drew a line between the funds meant for the party and for his own expenses. He had expensive habits, including flying, which, according to parliamentary records, cost fuel charges of 3,600 rupees a day. Both sons, Sanjay and Rajiv, lived with their wives and children (Sanjay had one son, Rajiv had two children—a son and a daughter) with the prime minister. There were wide rumors that Sanjay’s financial affairs were carried out with his mother’s knowledge, and perhaps some substantial amounts were transferred to Swiss bank accounts.

Sanjay’s most notorious campaigns during the emergency rule included forcible vasectomies as a means of family planning on those who lived in Delhi slums and the eviction of an estimated 700,000 squatters and slum dwellers from their huts, which were summarily destroyed. Some of those who resisted near the Turkman Gate were shot dead. Incidents of this kind were repeated elsewhere, particularly in Indira Gandhi’s home state of Uttar Pradesh, where, according to the Economist of London on December 4, 1976, in twenty-one such incidents, police opened fire and killed 467 people to make room for some beautification projects. Vasectomy was forced on men even in their seventies and eighties. Riders in buses were ordered to come out and were sterilized in makeshift tents. There was tremendous panic created by these drives not just among the people immediately affected. Others wondered, “When will this reign of terror stop?”

Sanjay soon became a law unto himself. He made and unmade chief ministers and announced major policy decisions in the name of his mother, without consulting with the cabinet minister concerned. A feeling spread among members of the Congress that Indira was preparing for a dynastic succession of her son Sanjay, who had used the emergency period to organize the Youth Congress on a large scale with himself as its supreme leader. The government-owned radio and television gave Sanjay tremendous exposure, lauding his various campaigns, subtly hailing him as the future leader. A wisecrack was, after the end of the emergency, to describe the emergency period as “one and a half person’s rule.” He did not specify whether Indira was the one or the half!

Indira, however, was not happy with the emergency and the criticism, particularly in the foreign media, leveled at her. One such criticism concerned the extension of the life of the Lok Sabha by one year, which the constitution allowed but had never been done before and has not been done since. A number of Western leaders and their ambassadors in New Delhi used every opportunity to convey to Indira most tactfully that it would be best to restore democracy. Perhaps bowing to such pressures and possibly because she herself believed she could not rule indefinitely without a public mandate, on January 18, 1977, Indira surprised everyone in India and abroad with her announcement that the next elections would be held in two months, in March 1977; she also ordered all political prisoners released. She was confident that the opposition leaders, with very little time to reorganize their lives and campaigns after nineteen months in prison, would be defeated in the elections and that she would emerge with a substantial majority in the new parliament.

india,year,"I hate hate HATEE this country, India and my life here","I hate this country. I hate that I was born here in India. Being born here feels like a curse, at least for me. So, for starters, I’m a 16 yr old transgender boy, born and raised in India. I have several valid reasons for absolutely despising this country from the very core of my soul. Let’s begin with the people, yep, the very proud *citizens* of India. You all know how insanely diverse this country is, right? Every state is like its own little country with different cultural practices, languages, shows, etc. But here’s a list of reasons why I think this country is a failure (there are *way* more, but these ones rlly piss me off):

1. **Extreme Pride**: So many Indians, both online and in real life, have this *ridiculous* inflated sense of pride. They believe India is superior to every other country and that it’s the absolute best. In reality? It’s not lol. They’re just too delusional to see it.

2. **Racism**: Yep, racism. Indians are some of the most racist people, *especially* towards fellow Indians. If you’re dark skinned Indian, other Indians won’t hesitate to throw disgusting, racist comments at you. 

3. **Caste System**: Can we talk about how messed up it is that we *still* have a caste system? Like, in 2025? Seriously?

4. **Lack of Civic Sense**: Indians, as a whole, lack *basic* civic sense. And no, you can’t just blame illiteracy because even well-educated, wealthy people throw trash in the streets like it’s their personal garbage bin. They’re out here littering the country and then turning around to say how “beautiful” and “better than other countries” it is. The irony is painful to say the least.

5. **Judgemental Society**: Everyone's got an opinion about you and they WILL make sure you hear it. Whether it's your clothes, career choices, gender, or who you love, you're *constantly* judged, scrutinized and looked down upon. Privacy is a complete joke here.

6. **Corruption Everywhere**: Bribery and corruption are so normal here, it's practically part of daily life. Need basic services? Better know someone or be ready to pay off some official. The system isn’t broken, it literally functions like this.

7. **Glorifying Suffering**: Struggles are romanticized here. Instead of fixing problems, people flex how much *pain* they’ve tolerated. It’s always “we survived worse” instead of “we deserve better.” It’s toxic asl.

8. **Education System:** Don’t even get me started on the education system. It kills creativity, mental health, and individuality. It’s just rote learning, unrealistic expectations, toxic competition and zero space for personal growth. Nobody gives a damn about what you actually want to do. There ain't much scope for careers like architecture, art, etc. it's always either engineer, doctor or lawyer.

9. **Queerphobia/Transphobia**: Being queer or trans in India is like asking to be treated like trash. People stare, mock, misgender, harass, and dehumanize you for simply existing. It's not just strangers, sometimes it's your own family, school, teachers, doctors. Support is rare and safe spaces? Almost nonexistent in this country. 

10. **Toxic Conservatism**: This country is too obsessed with clinging to outdated traditions and moral policing. People here act like personal freedom is a threat to society. Wear what you want? You're “asking for it.” Speak up? “You're too westernized.” Think differently? “Disrespectful.”

11. **Indians are the biggest hypocrites**: Indians L.O.V.E. preaching “respect,” “tradition,” and “values” but where is that energy when women are getting harassed in broad daylight every other day? When people are abused for their caste or identity? It's all fake, performative morality.

12. **Forced Patriotism**: You can’t criticize the country without being called “anti national.” Like sorry bro, wanting a country to be better isn’t hating it, it’s expecting *basic* humanity. But people here just don’t get that. They’d rather live in denial than face the truth.

13. **Neglected Mental Health**: Mental health is either ignored or mocked in India. There aren't enough therapists, especially queer affirming ones. Public hospitals barely have mental health professionals and private help is expensive. Plus, families often dismiss it as “drama” or “attention seeking.” You're left to fight your mind alone. That's another reason why depression and suicide rates in India are rising rapidly.

Anyway, I'm done for now. There are a lot more issues I cannot mention in this post. These were just a few I've observed and personally experienced in my 16 years of living here.

Edit: 
Here are 12 more issues I've seen because some of y'all just won't sthu and accept how flawed your country really is. Someone NEEDS to speak up. :

14. **Poverty Ignored**: India LOVES showing off its billionaires and skyscrapers, but what about the millions living in slums, without any clean water or food? Poverty here isn’t just a “developing country issue” it’s a systemic failure that both, the government and society conveniently ignore.

15. **Rape Culture**: The number of rape cases reported in India is jst horrifying and that’s *just* the reported ones. Victim blaming is so common, police often refuse to file complaints and rapists walk free while survivors are shamed and silenced.

16. **Fake Democracy**: India claims to be the “largest democracy,” but in reality? Voices are silenced, dissent is criminalized, journalists are jailed and elections are full of manipulation. It’s a democracy in *name only*. 

17. **Religious Extremism**: Religion has become a political weapon in India. Hate crimes, riots and lynchings happen in the name of faith. If you don’t belong to the majority religion, you’re automatically “less Indian” in many people’s eyes.

18. **Patriarchy Everywhere**: This society still treats women like shit, 2nd class citizens. From birth, girls are told to stay quiet, sacrifice their dreams, and prioritize everyone else. Feminism is mocked and asking for equal rights is treated like a threat still. Female infanticide still exists in several parts of India. 

19. **Lack of Accessibility**: India is extremely unfriendly to disabled people. Public spaces rarely have ramps, accessible transport is almost non existent and inclusive education is a joke. It’s like people with disabilities are invisible here.

20. **Fake Progress**: This country LOVES to brag about development but it’s mostly jst surface level. A few metro cities might look shiny, but rural areas still lack basic healthcare, clean drinking water and decent roads. 

21. **Toxic Nationalism in Schools**: Kids are brainwashed from a very young age to blindly worship the country. There’s zero room for questioning history, policies or even basic facts. You’re taught to obey, not to think.

22. **Zero Work-Life Balance**: The culture here is so toxic. People are expected to overwork, underpaid jobs are normalized and taking care of your mental health is seen as laziness like I mentioned earlier. Rest is treated like a luxury, not a necessity.

23. **No Legal Protection for Queer Relationships**: Queer people still can’t legally marry, adopt, or even access basic relationship rights. The government refuses to recognize LGBTQIA+ people as equal citizens because we “don’t align with Indian culture.”

24. **Brain Drain**: Talented people keep leaving India. Why? because the environment here is so hostile to creativity, to freedom, to ambition. If you're smart and different, this country will try to shut you down. 

25. **No Sex Education**: There’s ZERO proper sex ed in most schools. As a result, kids grow up clueless about consent, safety, and bodies leading to abuse, unplanned pregnancies, and shame. It’s a public health crisis no one wants to fix. That’s also a HUGE reason why India has such an overwhelming and unmanageable population because people aren’t taught how not to contribute to it.

**Anyway, I’m done fr now. The so-called ""Indians"" in the comments are doing a flawless job proving every single point I made. It’s honestly just embarrassing and disgusting at this point lmao.**

*Edit 2* : To those saying I should just leave India, I definitely will. I’ve wanted to for a long time. But it won’t be an escape, it’ll be a choice. Like anyone else, I just want to live a good life. I know I deserve better regardless of what other ppl have to say. If I can feel welcome and find love, freedom, safety, and acceptance in another country, things my birth country never gave me, then I’ll leave without hesitation.

*Edit 3* : And to those saying my post was written by AI, I appreciate the accidental compliment lol. I guess my writing’s finally leveling up!

india,year,Why I hate Narendra Modi,"While most of North India chokes, I was just watching how China managed to improve its air quality by 55% in just 10 years. Then I came across stories of how it significantly reduced ground-level corruption. What made these changes possible was a central government that dared to take bold, decisive actions. 

Now, I would never trade India’s democracy for an authoritarian regime like China’s (though we are very close to it). But what pains me is this—Narendra Modi had a CCP-like decision making power thanks to his strong majority. He had 10 years to pass landmark bills that only a government with this kind of majority can. 

What could Modi have achieved?

	•	A powerful Anti-Corruption Act and update the Police Act so that citizens are not afraid of police. 

	•	A game-changing Environment Protection Law that could have let citizens breathe. 
	•	Tax Reform to Eliminate Evasion to create a more equal society. 
	•	Healthcare and Education reform so that poor kids don’t die in hospital fires and everyone gets a fair shot at life.  

Narendra Modi had the power. The people were hopeful. The stage was set for transformative policies that could have made crores of lives better.

But what did Modi choose?

We all know the answer. None of the above. Instead, we saw a focus on polarizing issues, diversionary tactics, and policies that seem designed to consolidate power to himself and his billionaire friends. 

This is why I feel so deeply disappointed. It’s not about ideology or party politics. It’s about an opportunity lost. Modi could have been the leader who defined India’s next 100 years, one whose legacy would be remembered fondly for centuries.

But instead, he chose the same old path of divisiveness, short-term gains, and power for power’s sake.

This is why I cannot support him—not because of what he did, but because of what he could have done.",3497,916,2024-11-28,GloomyPsychology5060,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1h26eic/why_i_hate_narendra_modi/,why i hate narendra modi,while most of north india chokes i was just watching how china managed to improve its air quality by in just years then i came across stories of how it significantly reduced groundlevel corruption what made these changes possible was a central government that dared to take bold decisive actions now i would never trade indias democracy for an authoritarian regime like chinas though we are very close to it but what pains me is thisnarendra modi had a ccplike decision making power thanks to his strong majority he had years to pass landmark bills that only a government with this kind of majority can what could modi have achieved a powerful anticorruption act and update the police act so that citizens are not afraid of police a gamechanging environment protection law that could have let citizens breathe tax reform to eliminate evasion to create a more equal society healthcare and education reform so that poor kids dont die in hospital fires and everyone gets a fair shot at life narendra modi had the power the people were hopeful the stage was set for transformative policies that could have made crores of lives better but what did modi choose we all know the answer none of the above instead we saw a focus on polarizing issues diversionary tactics and policies that seem designed to consolidate power to himself and his billionaire friends this is why i feel so deeply disappointed its not about ideology or party politics its about an opportunity lost modi could have been the leader who defined indias next years one whose legacy would be remembered fondly for centuries but instead he chose the same old path of divisiveness shortterm gains and power for powers sake this is why i cannot support himnot because of what he did but because of what he could have done,hate narendra modi,north india chokes watching china managed improve air quality years came across stories significantly reduced groundlevel corruption made changes possible central government dared take bold decisive actions would never trade indias democracy authoritarian regime like chinas though close pains thisnarendra modi ccplike decision making power thanks strong majority years pass landmark bills government kind majority could modi achieved powerful anticorruption act update police act citizens afraid police gamechanging environment protection law could let citizens breathe tax reform eliminate evasion create equal society healthcare education reform poor kids dont die hospital fires everyone gets fair shot life narendra modi power people hopeful stage set transformative policies could made crores lives better modi choose know answer none instead saw focus polarizing issues diversionary tactics policies seem designed consolidate power billionaire friends feel deeply disappointed ideology party politics opportunity lost modi could leader defined indias next years one whose legacy would remembered fondly centuries instead chose old path divisiveness shortterm gains power powers sake cannot support himnot could done,False,-0.24414226412773132,Neutral,Real Text
india,year,Hindi isn't the local language of the place I live.,"

I am from Thamizh/Tamil Nadu and I can speak தமிழ், English and know some Japanese. I'm going to talk something. 🙂

# Can't learn Hindi, but happily learn other foreign languages?

I am learning Japanese, coz I have interest the language and consume Japanese resources/media and like to explore their culture. I haven't learnt Hindi, because it doesn't serves any purpose to me. The necessity or interest is not there for me. I don't consume Hindi resources or planning to stay/work in the hindi-belt.

# People are willing to have English as a link language/2nd language and would have all their kids get enrolled in English medium schools, but can't learn Hindi?

English is different. It is **FAR MORE BENEFICIAL** than Hindi and I have never seen an English native come to Tamil Nadu and mocked me for not knowing English but I have seen many Hindi speakers (even literates) mocking other state people for not knowing Hindi and calling it national language when it ISN'T. The arrogance shown by Hindi speakers in a Non-Hindi State is enough of a reason to reject a 3rd Mandatory language policy that indirectly imposes Hindi.

# Some Hindi Speakers are ignorant
How can you assume that everyone understands Hindi and make posts in Hindi in non-hindi specific subreddits like r/india (subs with more Indians) and r/Doraemon, r/shinchan (the last two were global subs for your knowledge.)

# Hindi overshadows and always had advantages/spotlights

There is a lot, but here is one of them: The union government exams (like UPSC CSE) have questions only in Hindi and English. Any Hindi speaker who can't understand English is benefitted by this. That's so nice of the government, but what about Non-Hindi Speakers who aren't good at English? Forgot about them?

# **Central Government is biased as hell!**

_An RTI application filed by The New Indian Express has revealed the disparity in fund allocation by the union government for the promotion of classical Indian languages. While the **union government released a grant of Rs 1,074 crore for the promotion of Sanskrit from 2017-2022**, as per an RTI reply sent by the Central Sanskrit University (CSU) in New Delhi, other classical languages such as Tamil, Telugu and Kannada have been getting significantly lower allocations. In response to unstarred questions by five MPs, the Ministry of Culture in 2020 stated that only **Rs 22.94 crore was allocated for Tamil** while Telugu and Kannada received Rs 3 crore each during 2017-20._

The funds alloted for language development shows how much the Central Govt. cares for other CLASSICAL and REGIONAL languages. 🤨

Don't come justifying the Hindi Imposition. I'll learn the language I wish to. One foreign language, which is lingua franca of world is enough.


P.S. Some scraped texts from this post:
The recent language issue is driving me crazy, like why you people are so forceful in imposing a language on a state that doesn't speak the language or don't have interest in a 3rd Mandatory Language? The state is already doing well with its Two-language Policy.

india,year,Why in the world is Sanskrit still being taught in schools?,"I don't mean to offend anyone, but I just don't understand a purpose for continuing to teach Sanskrit. No one speaks Sanskrit any more. It's basically an extinct language at this point. 

I understand that Sanskrit is historically and culturally significant, but teaching it as a mandatory subject is just unnecessary when kids could be learning languages that they can actually use in daily life. 

Hours and hours are wasted on Sanskrit, when the teachers themselves can't speak it fluently. Even if they could, what of it? What purpose does it serve? The vast majority of children just slog through the textbooks to pass their board exams and then never think of Sanskrit ever again. 

I learned Sanskrit for 5 years, but I can't remember a single Sanskrit word. Most of Sanskrit taught in schools focuses on rote memorization instead of on actually developing a deep understanding of the language. Children just memorise Sanskrit question-answers like a script, so what's the point? 

Why continue to force this mostly dead language on kids who are already stressed enough as it is? Like, what is the practical purpose? I don't see the language making a comeback ever again. Sanskrit had its time. It's mostly dead now. Why continue to beat a dead horse? 

Edit: People are mass downvoting and acting like I have a personal grudge against Sanskrit. Guys, I'm not against Sanskrit or our cultural heritage. I'm all for us learning about our history and traditions, but the way Sanskrit is being taught in schools now, IT IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS. All it's doing is adding to students' burden. Continuing to teach Sanskrit in this manner is not going to revive the language. Sanskrit teachers don't know shit about the language they're teaching. Most Sanskrit teachers only have surface level knowledge of the subject. This is just added stress serving no real purpose. Either remove it, or reform the way it's being taught. Or, you could make it an optional subject instead. Not sure why people think I'm hating India by expressing this opinion. 

Edit2: Haha, people have resorted to name calling and insulting my intelligence for the comment I made that I don't remember any Sanskrit. Very nice, everyone. 

Did you not read anything I wrote? I've already said the focus is more on rote learning, and guess what people forget things learned that way. You can actually express an opinion without resorting to name calling and insults like animals. You won't change anyone's mind by insulting them. You all are coming at me like a pack of rabid dogs. 

Someone name calls and I just lose all respect for them and stop trusting their judgement. What is it about this topic that's making you so angry you're sending me vile DMs? I'm just some rando. I'm not omnipotent wiping out Sanskrit as a whole from existence. My opinion does not matter in the slightest and will not affect any educational policies whatsoever bro move on with your life.

india,year,Make Believe in Bharat: Tariff King Piyush Goyal Gaslights India and the World,"In remarks reported by Shruti Srivastava for Bloomberg, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal claims that India's tariffs on U.S. goods are modest -- averaging just 7-8% -- because the steepest duties falls on products India doesn't import.

It's a technically precise, strategically misleading assertion. It's also a classic case of official antinomy: the deliberate disjunction between rhetorical liberalism and operational illiberalism that defines much of Indian policymaking. Goyal's performance continues to remain more about narrative management rather than maintaining transparency -- weaponising averages to obfuscate intent.

New Delhi likes to posture as a willing participant in global trade, while its tariff regime actively suppresses integration, insulating domestic inefficiencies under the guise of ""sovereignty"". In this context, the policy contradictions aren't incidental, they form the governing logic.

The core of Goyal's claim rests on circular reasoning: India does not import certain goods, therefore high tariffs on them are immaterial. But India doesn't import these goods \_precisely because\_ the tariffs are designed to preclude that possibility. It's not the absence of demand -- it's the policy-induced exclusion.

Moreover, the quoted average tariff is statistically hollow, diluted by lines with minimal trade relevance to the U.S. -- zero-duty raw materials or intermediate goods India doesn't source from America. These low-duty items drag the average down and hide the real story: that tariffs on the goods the US actually wants to export - like whiskey, motorbikes, cars, and farm products - are still sky-high.

This is not an accidental oversight; it's a deliberate construction to protect politically protected constituencies within India (read: oligarchs, middlemen and trader cartels) that Goyal ultimately represents. India's trade rules are not shaped by the market. They're shaped by a system built to protect local industries and shut out competition. This is not a flaw -- it is the deliberate architecture of policy in New Delhi whose  reflexes stem not from economic logic, but from a deep-seated autarkic impulse to dominate and control the remaining provinces it still lords over with simmering, jealous centralism.

india,year,BJP under fire for using India-Pakistan tensions for political gain,"As tensions escalate between India and Pakistan following the launch of Operation Sindoor, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has come under sharp criticism for attempting to politicise the national security crisis through a social media campaign that many have deemed inappropriate and divisive.

On May 9, while border areas remained on edge amid a military standoff between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, the BJP released a video extolling Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s aggressive posture in dealing with cross-border terrorism. The video juxtaposed Modi’s military responses with what it portrayed as the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance’s (UPA) “meek” approach, listing terror attacks such as the 2005 Delhi blasts, the 2006 Mumbai train bombings, the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and the 2010 Pune bombing as examples of Congress’s alleged failure to act decisively.

The BJP’s post contrasted these events with Modi’s policy of not engaging in peace talks, instead carrying out precision strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. However, the timing and tone of the campaign were widely condemned, even by those sympathetic to the party.

Psephologist Yashwant Deshmukh took to X (formerly Twitter), calling the campaign “absolutely disgraceful” and warned that it undermines national unity. “Pakistani media is saying you are doing all this for your own political gains, and this kind of stupid campaign gives them legitimacy. This is not the time for political differences but a time to take everyone along,” he wrote.

Political analyst Sumanth Raman echoed the sentiment, stating, “At a time when the entire country is united they put this out. Shameful. This is NOT the time for trying to score political points.”

Journalist Rohini Singh also criticised the move, calling it “pathetic” and adding, “What makes it even more pathetic [is] that it’s being done at this time when the nation is united.”

Actor and activist Gul Panag weighed in, urging restraint and unity: “The nation today stands UNITED, across the political spectrum. After a very long time. Please don’t play petty politics at this time,” she posted.

Several commentators pointed out the factual distortions in the BJP’s video, noting that it was under the UPA government that Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving terrorist from the 2008 Mumbai attacks, was captured, tried, and executed. They questioned whether the current administration has shown similar resolve in apprehending those responsible for the Pahalgam attack.

Critics argue that the BJP’s attempt to score political points amid an active conflict not only erodes the spirit of national unity but also risks giving propaganda fodder to hostile forces. At a time when Indian Armed Forces are engaged in real-time operations, many expressed that such rhetoric as irresponsible and damaging.

In stark contrast, the Congress party has refrained from politicising the situation. On May 7, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge publicly supported the Armed Forces and lauded their action. “We are extremely proud of our Indian Armed Forces who have struck terror camps in Pakistan and PoK. We applaud their resolute resolve and courage,” he said in a statement. Emphasising unity, he added, “National Unity and solidarity is the need of the hour and the Indian National Congress stands with our Armed Forces.”",709,156,2025-05-10,opinion_discarder,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1kj8jru/bjp_under_fire_for_using_indiapakistan_tensions/,bjp under fire for using indiapakistan tensions for

india,year,The JEE Advanced 2025 Policy Reversal: A Crisis in India’s Higher Education System,"The recent policy reversal surrounding the eligibility criteria for JEE Advanced 2025 has caused widespread outrage and despair among students and their families. On **5th November 2024**, IIT Kanpur, the organizing institute for JEE Advanced 2025, made a groundbreaking announcement allowing students three consecutive attempts to appear for the exam, instead of the previous two-attempt limit. For thousands of aspirants, this decision came as a ray of hope—an opportunity to reclaim their dreams of securing a seat at one of India’s prestigious IITs. However, just **13 days later**, this decision was inexplicably rescinded, reverting to the two-attempt rule, leaving aspirants in shock and disarray.

This sudden reversal has devastated the lives of countless students who relied on the initial announcement. Many had already dropped out of their current college programs at NITs, IIITs, and other institutions, vacated hostels, and invested heavily in coaching programs to prepare for this additional opportunity. The abrupt rollback has left these students with no viable options, and their families are struggling to cope with the emotional and financial fallout.

Students who acted on the initial announcement feel betrayed. The policy change was announced on the official JEE Advanced website, a platform trusted by aspirants and parents alike. Such a decision, coming from an institution of IIT Kanpur's stature, was perceived as credible and final. The reversal, however, has shattered this trust, leading to a crisis of confidence in the system. Aspirants now find themselves grappling with depression, anxiety, and an overwhelming sense of helplessness.

Financially, the impact has been significant. Families, particularly those with limited resources, made sacrifices to fund their children's preparation. Many enrolled in expensive coaching programs and purchased study materials, believing in the legitimacy of the initial announcement. For them, this reversal has been nothing short of catastrophic, as the investments they made now seem futile.

This issue also raises questions about the timing and implementation of such policy changes. Major changes to eligibility criteria should be announced well in advance—ideally in June or earlier—and should apply to a future admission cycle, such as JEE 2026. This would allow students ample time to plan their academic and career paths without disruption. The mid-cycle change and subsequent rollback reflect a lack of foresight and accountability on the part of the Joint Admission Board (JAB).

Another concern is the inconsistency between the eligibility criteria for JEE Mains and JEE Advanced. While JEE Mains allows students three consecutive attempts, JEE Advanced restricts them to two. Given that the two exams are interconnected, this disparity is both illogical and unfair, further complicating the situation for aspirants.

Adding to the frustration is the muted response from the media and educational stakeholders. While similar crises in exams like NEET often receive nationwide attention, the plight of JEE aspirants has gone largely unnoticed. Students are left to fight their battle alone, writing to IIT directors, the Ministry of Higher Education, and even the Prime Minister’s Office, pleading for intervention.

The students’ demands are simple: reinstate the three-attempt rule for JEE Advanced 2025 and provide clarity and stability in policy decisions going forward. This is not just about an exam; it is about the futures of thousands of students who trusted the system and acted in good faith.

The abrupt reversal has not only disrupted lives but also exposed deep flaws in the decision-making process of India’s premier educational institutions. The question now is whether the authorities will step up, acknowledge their mistakes, and act to restore trust and fairness in the system, or whether the voices of these students will continue to be ignored. For a nation that prides itself on its education system, this is a moment to reflect and course-correct.

india,year,"How Airlines in India Use ""NO Invoice"" AS a Loophole to Deny Baggage Compensation","On 27 March 2025, I flew with Akasa Air (Flight QP-1738) from Mumbai to Bengaluru. Upon arrival, I found my Swiss Military bag with Qualcomm branding—clearly marked with a FRAGILE tag—completely damaged.

I immediately filed a PIR (DPRBLRQP035112) at the airport.

Here’s what happened after that:

I was offered ₹1500, then ₹2400, and finally ₹3000

BUT only if I signed an indemnity form waiving my right to any further claim

When I questioned the offer, I was told:

> “If you escalate this, you may not even get ₹1500”
(Yes, I have recordings.)



When I refused to settle, I was asked to produce an invoice — even after clearly stating the bag was a corporate gift, which obviously doesn’t come with a bill


Meanwhile, I’ve filed:

Consumer Grievance No. 6953548

AirSewa Complaint ID: GE971674


But it’s been over 3 weeks, and Akasa Air refuses to budge. No review of my documents, no valuation, no human empathy — just a templated “final offer” and silence.

And the best part?
Their own policy caps compensation at ₹350/kg up to ₹25,000.
DGCA rules (CAR Section 3, Series M, Part IV) allow up to ₹20,000 for baggage damage.
But they’re still using “no invoice” as an excuse to deny fair compensation.

This isn’t just about money. It’s about the systemic bullying of passengers who ask for accountability.
I’ve spent hours sending emails, filing forms, and following up.
And I’m not done.

If you’ve ever had a bag damaged, delayed, or lost and got brushed aside with an insultingly low offer — please share your experience.
If anyone knows a stronger legal way to push this further (media coverage, PIL, NCDRC escalation), I’m all ears.

Let’s not stay quiet. We deserve better.

TL;DR:
Akasa Air broke my fragile-tagged bag, offered me ₹3000 with conditions, and told me not to escalate. I’ve filed formal complaints, but I’m still being stonewalled. This is a pattern — not an exception.

india,year,Nirmala seems like a scapegoat: Good game from BJP,"

Over time the case of Nirmala being the finance minister has been really curious to me. There are others who are better suited and definitely have a better impression on public(at least own voters of BJP). But still for some reason they have continued with her. 

I kept thinking why not replace with someone else and just pacify the public a bit. We do know that it’s the supreme leader who decides everything and Tai is just a pawn. I feel like BJP will continue with her and keep fucking up the middle class and working class, this will definitely anger its own voter class as well. 

2-3 budgets more and the entire working class is going to be hating BJP and Tai; the swing which is going away from BJP already in this last election will be further in INDIA favour. Supreme leader can just play a master stroke 1-2 years before the next election. They will drop her, make the taxes a bit favourable in that last budget and show like Tai was the culprit all along and it is going to be an up trend now. Give their voters who are going away from them a feeling that it’s going to be better for them in the budgets post the election. 

Tai is basically being demonised already, keeping her in the same portfolio despite all the criticism, making middle-class-back-breaking policies by keeping her as the face of all of this, making her give bullshit statements and Gadkari giving a public letter against his own minister colleague instead of communicating directly! They will just drop her before elections and try to woo its voter population back; and they will happily be back as well. 

I predicted this before, reminding again. Just sit back and watch this turn into the reality.

india,year,My Brother's Addiction is Tearing My Family Apart – What Can I Do?,"Hi, I’m 23M, living with my mom and brother. My dad has to travel often for work, and right now, he’s in another state.

My brother (30M) has been addicted to weed for over eight years, and for the past 3-4 years, he’s been dealing with mental health issues caused by it. He smokes multiple times a day, every single day. Most of the time, he’s out and only comes home at night to eat and sleep.

When my dad was around, he was strict—sometimes even physically aggressive, which we didn’t like. But given our financial struggles (my dad and I are working hard to pay off debts while my brother keeps adding to our problems), my dad’s frustration was understandable. Even though we disapproved of his methods, my brother at least had some fear of him, which kept him somewhat in check.

We’ve tried psychiatric medication before, and at times, it has helped. There were phases where he stopped smoking for months, spending his time watching movies and playing games. But the moment he starts feeling mentally stable again, he goes right back to smoking.

My mom is a deeply emotional and soft-hearted person—she literally experiences chest pain from all this stress. She loves both of us too much to let go of him, no matter what he does.

**Who My Brother Used to Be**

Before all this, he was an extraordinary person—great at sports, popular, a bit of a troublemaker, but naturally smart. He barely studied but still got decent grades. He had a kind heart and was well-liked.

**The Trauma He’s Put Us Through**

One time, he disappeared and came back with over ₹3 lakhs in personal loans that his addict friends tricked him into taking. We had to pay it off.

He sometimes says absurd, socially unacceptable things that make me feel terrible for him.

He spent his entire salary in a single day on his so-called friends. He used to work but would quit after getting just one paycheck. It’s been years since he held a job.

Despite this, he could still pass interviews at MNCs, though mostly for call center or tech support jobs.

He has given away brand-new phones to random people. We stopped giving him a phone years ago to limit his contact with bad influences.


If i remember correctly he has schizo-obsessive disorder, which is caused by weed and it worsens it even more.

But ever since my dad left for work this time after a while a few weeks ago, my brother has completely spiraled out of control. He disappears for days, and the more he smokes, the more paranoid and delusional he becomes—trusting us less and less. 

So we scraped together whatever we could and decided to send him to rehab for 8-9 months, hoping he’d finally get consistent treatment and improve. He was gone for past 2 days so I went to his usual place luckily found him ther and had a friend trick him into staying at his place for a few hours while I secretly arranged for the rehab team to come pick him up. But at the last moment, after all the paperwork was done, he escaped. A while later, he called us from someone else’s phone, saying he was going to Kashi and would never come back.

That was yesterday. This morning, one of my friends spotted him, so I know he’s still in our locality. He has no problem sleeping on the streets, in temples—wherever he finds space.

The Worst Part – Watching My Mom Suffer

Every night, my mom sits by the window, hoping he’ll come home for dinner at least. Watching her like this breaks me. I don’t know how much longer I can take this.

And deep down I know even my brother is not happy he just doesn't know a way out. He has admitted multiple times when that smoking doesn't help him anymore. But when he get those mental issues he doesn't knows any better.

I want to help. But I don’t know what to do anymore. Has anyone dealt with something like this? What can I do?

Please don't suggest that we have to let go of him, because even though my dad has tried my mom was never able to do so and if my mom is broken, I'm broken too. For me there is no one else in this world for other than my mom.

Edit: After reading comments, as some of them are suggesting underlying mental issues is the root cause. Although I doubt it because I've seen direct impact of smoking weed on his mental health. When he becomes ok after being of meds for a few months he is that way until he starts smoking again. And I've seen this cycle over and over again. But taking that possibility into consideration that he did have underlying mental issues. In that case I'm willing to put him in mental institution because the rehab we can afford, doesn't seem like they could understand his mental issues, they might just give me sleep pills to make him lazy and ease their job. Which mental institution are best and how much they cost and how would I get him there?. We live in near abouts of Mumbai. And they are people who are completely crazy in mental institution is it ok to put him aside them.


Edit: i went to his adda and he was sleeping on a mad mans (there is a guy) mattress. I sat beside him. And talked to him for a bit (after a while i realised it's been a while since I talked to him openly). He came home with me i promised him I won't do rehab. But I know he needs psychiatric help. I suggested him about it but he is refusing, he says he has treated his mental problems. I don't know how to proceed. I am thinking of going to a iskcon temple, it's been forever since we had quite family time. I want to preserve this good memory between the chaos. Or after temple should I just insist to, together me and i see a therapist? I can probably convince him no meds just therapy.

Edit: We have successfully departed him for rehab. He was disappointed in me. It broke me. At the end he said ""take care of the family I'll be alright"". I hope he is okay there. And they take care of him, rather than forcing him to do somethings. The rehab has policy of not meeting till 6 months. I'm now unsure of the rehab and how good it is because we could only afford a low budget rehab. It'll 10k inr a months. For first month it is more. Should be careful or should I let rehab take care of him?

india,year,Why the Delay in the Indian Census is a Big Deal and How It’s Affecting Us,"Hey everyone,  
I have been thinking a lot about the Indian census and how it’s been delayed for years now. The last census was in 2011, and we were supposed to have another one in 2021, but it still hasn’t happened. This delay is causing some serious issues, and I wanted to discuss why the census is so important and how this delay is affecting the country.

**Why is the Census Important?**

1. **Accurate Data for Policy Making:** The census provides the most reliable data on population, demographics, literacy, employment, housing, and more. Without this data, governments can’t make informed decisions about resource allocation, welfare schemes, or infrastructure development.
2. **Identifying Marginalized Groups:** The census helps identify marginalized communities, including Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes. This data is crucial for implementing affirmative action and ensuring social justice.
3. **Economic Planning:** Businesses, researchers, and policymakers rely on census data to understand market trends, plan investments, and create economic policies. Without updated data, we’re essentially flying blind.
4. **Disaster Management and Healthcare:** During crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, accurate population data is essential for vaccine distribution, healthcare planning, and disaster relief. The lack of updated census data makes these efforts less effective.

**How is the Delay Affecting Us?**

1. **Outdated Policies:** Many government schemes and policies are still based on 2011 data. India’s population has grown significantly since then, and the demographics have shifted. This means policies might not be reaching the right people or addressing current needs.
2. **Urbanization Challenges:** Cities are growing rapidly, but without updated census data, urban planning is a mess. Issues like housing shortages, traffic congestion, and inadequate public services are becoming worse.
3. **Education and Employment:** The lack of current data on literacy rates, school enrollment, and employment trends makes it harder to address issues like skill development and job creation.
4. **Political Representation:** Census data is used to redraw electoral constituencies. Delays mean that political representation isn’t keeping up with population changes, leading to unequal representation.

**Why the Delay?**

The official reason for the delay is the COVID-19 pandemic, but it’s been years since the worst of the pandemic, and there’s still no clear timeline for when the census will happen. Some people also speculate that the government might be avoiding the census because the data could reveal uncomfortable truths about unemployment, poverty, or the impact of certain policies.

**What Can We Do?**

We need to raise awareness about the importance of the census and push the government to prioritize it. The census isn’t just a bureaucratic exercise, it’s a tool for social and economic progress. Without it, we’re essentially navigating the future of 1.4 billion people in the dark.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you think the delay is intentional, or is it just bureaucratic inefficiency? How do you think this is impacting your community? Let’s discuss!

india,year,We're Not Dirty People. So Why Do We Live Like This?,"Our environment is in shambles, and guess what? Our mindset is just as messed up. The roads are crumbling, the air is choking, and it’s like we’ve all become numb to this chaos. We’ve accepted it as the norm, like it’s some part of Indian life. But hold up, it doesn’t have to be!

Here’s the thing: all this isn’t just a nuisance; it’s downright unhealthy. Chronic coughs, allergies, fatigue, poor lung function, waterborne infections - all these are linked to our poor civic habits. And lectures won’t cut it. We need a complete mental makeover of what’s considered normal and cool in our society.

Let’s start treating littering and spitting like we treat body odor in a crowded room. Just… eww! Imagine if throwing garbage on the road wasn’t seen as casual, but as a sign of being primitive or low-IQ. Like, “Oh… this guy throws chips wrappers on the street. Must be a total cockroach energy.”

Or someone honking nonstop? Call it out with a smirk: “Ah, the trumpet brigade has arrived.” Make it sound absurd.

Someone peeing in public? Give it a label: “Marking territory like a wild animal.” And say it out loud (or even mutter it under your breath if you’re not feeling bold).

Spitting paan in corners? “Ah, the artist has struck again - red Picasso.” Make the act sound pathetic, not tough.

Wrong side driving? “Oh look, a street-level rebel without a cause.” Make them feel like an oddball, not a hero.

We don’t need rules. We need new social instincts. Imagine if people started feeling low-class or embarrassed when they littered or broke basic civic sense - not because a cop fined them, but because people around them looked at them the same way you’d look at someone picking their nose during dinner.

When good behavior isn’t perceived as “trying too hard” but simply as normal, a shift occurs. For instance, carrying your own water bottle instead of buying three plastic ones daily, waiting at a red light like a responsible adult, or putting trash in your bag when there’s no bin nearby. These small acts should become signals of class, intelligence, and self-respect, not peculiar exceptions.

This isn’t about being “moral police.” It’s about building a social immune system that rejects the habits that make us all unwell. If we treat public filth the same way we treat a foul odor in our own living room—instantly uncomfortable, something to be eliminated—then real change begins.

So, yeah, start the shift. React, comment, raise an eyebrow, or laugh at absurd behavior when you witness it. Make it uncool, awkward, and cringeworthy to disrespect shared spaces. The more people feel that public neglect is embarrassing, like being sweaty on a date, the more we’ll all adjust in the right direction.

Remember, change doesn’t begin with protests or policies. Sometimes, it starts with a raised eyebrow and a silent “Bro, what are you—a pigeon?”

Here are some more fantastic suggestions:

1. An All-India Civic Action Showcase Website:

A platform where citizens from all corners of India can document and showcase their small but powerful civic actions. These actions could include cleaning their lanes, planting trees and tracking their growth, organizing community cleanups, or even helping a neighbor create a compost pit.

This isn’t about praising; it’s about increasing visibility and normalization. When people witness others taking real action, it gradually erodes apathy. There’s no politics or authority involved; it’s simply humans doing their part and demonstrating that it can be done.

2. Neighborhood Responsibility Roster:

Each building or lane can have a shared group (using WhatsApp, Telegram, or offline communication) where members take turns each week performing small acts. These acts could include sweeping a patch, checking for garbage accumulation, or gently reminding others when needed. This approach is peer-to-peer, not top-down.

3. Shared Dustbin Culture:

In areas where bins are missing, a few neighbors can contribute by placing large, covered containers (secured with bricks or ropes) in designated public spots. Everyone nearby uses this container, and one or two individuals rotate weekly to empty it into a proper location or coordinate with scrap collectors. This system works effectively if people agree to maintain its functionality.

4. DIY Signage Movement:

Create your own civic signs and display them in public places. Laminate them if possible. Here are some examples of signs:

\- “No spitting. No one wants your DNA here.”

\- “Trash goes in the bin, not around it.”

\- “Litter here and you’ll be remembered as the person who never grew up.”

These signs, whether creatively designed or even humorous, are more effective when placed by local residents. People are more likely to follow a rule when they know someone nearby cares enough to put it up.

5. The Cleanliness Chain Reaction:

When someone starts cleaning even a small area regularly, such as outside their home or gate, others tend to join in. Encourage this behavior openly. For instance, sweep your front lane, pick up wrappers, and don’t explain the reason behind your actions. Simply let others see that you care. Quiet action is more effective than loud lectures.

6. “Bring One Bag” Rule Among Friends:

Whenever you go out for walks, treks, or even to the market, carry a spare small bag for litter. Pick up 2-3 pieces of trash along the way. Do this without making a scene. If your circle of friends follows this rule, others nearby will notice.

7. Public “Before-After” Wall in Your Locality:

Create a public “before-after” wall in your locality to showcase the positive impact of cleanliness. Display pictures of the area before and after cleaning efforts. This visual representation can inspire others to take action and contribute to a cleaner environment.

Stick A4 photos on a society or community board showcasing how you cleaned a patch, even a corner with ten wrappers. Encourage others to share their own experiences. There’s no reward, just a gradual psychological reminder that change is real, visible, and doesn’t require permission.

8. Friendly Naming and Shaming with Humor

If someone consistently littered in your area, give them a playful nickname within your group, like “That’s Ramesh Corner again” or “Looks like Paanwallah struck again.” Use humor instead of aggression. This approach spreads social pressure without resorting to confrontation.

9. Lend-a-Broom Movement

Keep a few spare brooms or dustpans in your society’s common area. Add a small board that says, “Use it if you see something dirty.” This symbolic gesture is effective because when people see tools ready for action, it subtly conveys the message that “we clean our own mess here.”

10. Plant Together, Water Alone

Residents can come together one weekend to plant small trees or saplings. Afterward, each person “adopts” one plant and is responsible for watering it regularly. This collaborative effort combined with individual responsibility fosters long-term respect without the need for teams or financial resources.

11. Use Peer Praise, Not Complaints

Instead of complaining about messy neighbors, actively praise clean behavior out loud. If someone puts trash in the right bin, say, “Good to see people like you.” Make this a natural part of your interactions. Civic pride spreads more rapidly when positive behavior is acknowledged rather than taken for granted.

We must take action at the most individual or small group level. We cannot wait for the government to implement societal behavioral reforms. No one should. It’s up to us to make a difference at an individual level. If we don’t, then who will?",157,47,2025-04-05,FearHound,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1js8ys3/were_not_dirty_people_so_why_do_we_live_like_this/,were not dirty people so why do we live like

india,year,A simple proposal: make the Kashmir Valley an independent country,"Not all of Jammu and Kashmir. Not Ladakh. Not the Pakistan occupied areas. Just the Kashmir Valley, Srinagar and a few surrounding districts.

The Valley is a small region with its own language, customs, and cultural identity. It has a long history that doesn't align neatly with either India or Pakistan. This isn’t about religion or nationalism. It’s just a reality, it’s different.

When British rule ended in 1947, princely states like Kashmir were supposed to choose their future. That choice was never clearly made for the Valley. A rushed accession happened under pressure, with the idea that a public vote would follow. That vote never took place.

Since then, the Valley has seen decades of violence, protests, shutdowns, and heavy military presence. Government after government has tried different approaches autonomy, integration, tough security but the basic conflict remains unresolved.

A different approach could be to let the Kashmir Valley become an independent country. It’s not a large region. It has the potential to survive with tourism, agriculture, and international support. It could become a neutral state in a sensitive part of the world.

There is often a fear that an independent Kashmir would be taken over by Pakistan or used as a base against India. That risk can be addressed through international agreements, legal guarantees, and monitoring. An independent Kashmir can be kept neutral, with no military alliances or foreign interference.

If Pakistan had been able to take control of the Valley, it likely would have done so during the chaos of earlier decades. That didn’t happen. Independence is not the same as alignment. A sovereign Kashmir could maintain its own foreign policy and protect its own borders.

This isn’t about assuming what people in the Valley think or want. It’s about giving them a fair chance to decide. A proper referendum, monitored internationally, could finally settle the matter. If the vote supports staying with India, the issue is closed. If not, peaceful independence becomes a valid option.

This proposal is not about rewarding violence or giving up land. It’s about ending a cycle that has gone on for generations. It offers a path to long term peace for the region and for the people who live in it.

india,year,Lizard Found in an In-Flight Meal of IndiGo,"# Saturday, March 30, 2024

I was flying with my younger brother on a domestic flight. It was an Indigo flight. The flight attendant served us our pre-booked meal, which was chicken cucumber sandwich. I took two bites from my sandwich, and then I saw the head of a dead lizard inside my sandwich. I started to feel unwell and disgusted. I called the flight attendant and informed her that I have found a foreign object in my sandwich. She inspected the sandwich and apologized to me. She then asked me if I want an alternative meal; to which I denied because I was very anxious. I asked her for the sandwich that I will keep to myself and once the flight lands, I will hand it over to the airport authorities for proper inspection. She told me that she can't give me the sandwich as it's the airline policy to keep it, so their catering team will inspect it. I agreed, as I didn't know much about that policy. But I asked her for the sandwich so that I could make a video of it as a proof. She agreed and gave me the sandwich, I made a proper video of the food along with the view of the flight. I also took out the head of the dead lizard on a tissue and captured it in the video closely. It is clearly visible that it is the head of a dead lizard. After this, I handed over the sandwich to the flight attendant. Now she saw that I found something in my food, but it didn't stop her from serving the same food to other passengers. She went on with her business.

The flight landed after a while. As I was exiting the airplane. I asked one of the flight attendants about the object I found in my food, to which she said smilingly, ""Oh, that! That was a piece of a chicken, sir."" I told her it was definitely not a chicken piece. But I realized that she was not going to agree, I dropped it and asked her if I can post the video I made of the sandwich. She said, ""it's your video, you can do whatever you want with it.""

**Later that evening:** I got a call from Taran (Customer Experience). He also confirmed (lied) that it was indeed a piece of a chicken. After his call I got a call from Pratik Arjun Sen (Director - Customer Experience and Training). He also lied to me the same thing. I asked him if you have analyzed it, may I see the report? He said that he cannot give me the report as it is highly confidential. But after an hour he called me once again and told me that he will give me the report under one condition that I cannot share it with anyone as it is highly confidential. Anyways, I agreed. He told me that he will send me the report on Monday.

# Monday, April 1, 2024

It was past 5pm and I am still yet to receive the report. I called him. He didn't pick up. I texted him about the report. At 6:40pm, I got an email from Indigo with the subject ""Chicken Sandwich"" and had a PDF attached. I opened the PDF and it was titled ""INVESTIGATION REPORT"" from Oberoi Flight Services. Here is what the report said:

>We have investigated the reported incident. The submitted sample was thoroughly examined in our in- house laboratory in the presence of Senior Chef and Indigo’s representative and our observations/ findings are as below-

1. The piece of concern was found to be 2cm long.

>2. The weight of the alleged piece of concern was found to be 1gm.

>3. The sample was thoroughly examined and checked under magnifying glass and confirmed to be a piece of chicken which is one of the main ingredient of the dish and misinterpreted as a FOB.

>In addition to all above, the sample was washed under running water for final check and confirmation after removal of debris over it and it is confirmed to be a piece of chicken. All related pictures and videos have been attached.

I checked the properties of the PDF. It was made using Microsoft Word.

I was not satisfied with the funny report. I responded back to the email asking for the sandwich so that I can have an independent analysis. Never got a response. I called him the next day and asked for the same thing. He said he cannot give me that due to some policies.

# Wednesday, April 3, 2024

I sent an email to Isha Gandhi (Nodal Officer) and Amrita Gill (Appellate Authority) regarding this whole incident. I got a call from Isha Gandhi at 7:47pm in the evening. She also confirmed me that it was a piece of a chicken as they have done lab test of the object. I asked for the object for independent investigation to which she denied saying that they cannot give me the sample but I can show the report to anybody. I was adamant for the object for independent analysis. She told me that the object is at the vendor's right now that she will ask the vendor and let me know by tomorrow if I can have it or not.

# Thursday, April 4, 2024

At 4:50pm, I got a call from Isha Gandhi. The Nodal Head of Catering Unit, Deepak Aggarwal was also on the call. Same thing he said that it was a piece of a chicken that they have investigated it. Now during the call I mentioned another incident in the past that happened with an Indigo passenger where she found a live worm in her veg sandwich. [Here is the link to that](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-passenger-claims-finding-worm-in-sandwich-indigo-served-notice-by-food-safety-regulator-airline-responds-101704295909491.html). Indigo never confirmed that but Deepak Aggarwal said about that incident ""I am not denying that. It happened one time. I take complete responsibility of that scene."" Isha interrupted in between that ""it was never established.""

Later during the call, Isha said that they cannot give me the sandwich for independent investigation because they have discarded the object in question because of their 48 hours hazard rule.

After the call. I sent an email to her asking for the written proof of the hazard rule with justification and justification for report confidentiality. I never got a reply.

I emailed and called her multiple times but she never answered or replied back to me.

# Moving Forward:

**I have call recordings of all the calls. I have all the emails I received and sent. I have the crystal clear video recording.** First I am going to send this entire documented incident to 3 news channels in India. I have already contacted them (My father was a news reporter, so I know people). I didn't do it earlier because of the elections. I wanted the entire nation to know about it. Now is the right time. After this, I will send them a legal notice. I will also start a public petition to terminate IndiGo's food license.

**Do you have any advice for me?**

>**I’ve just shared this story on Twitter. If you believe in holding companies accountable and ensuring food safety, please show your support by retweeting and spreading the word. Together, we can make sure incidents like this don’t go unnoticed. Your support means a lot! —** [**Here is the tweet**](https://x.com/Misunderstmd/status/1822523464051294251)

india,year,How India is an Oligarchy and the next step is State Corporatism.,"Oligarchy means power is in the hands of a small, elite group—typically wealthy or politically dominant families or corporate interests.

In India, political dynasties, corporate bigwigs, and media barons hold disproportionate influence over policy, elections, and public opinion. Though BJP is not a political dynasty but Top 1 percent holds 40 percent of GDP contribution and BJP clearly serves interests of Ambani and Adani

Electoral bonds (now scrapped) made it worse—opaque donations from big corporates to parties without accountability. It was the legalized bribing system which may have led to many corrupt companies getting away from getting shutdown.

State corporatism is when the government officially recognizes and integrates corporate or sectoral interest groups into its policymaking structure, often controlling and regulating them.

India’s increasing reliance on big business for public services (infrastructure, railways, healthcare) is a soft creep in that direction.

Look at the Adani-Modi axis, privatization of national assets, and the “Make in India” push tailored more for *big players* than for small ones.

india,year,Trump’s India-Pakistan ceasefire claims and what they reveal about US strategic thinking,"At the recent US-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh, Donald Trump once again claimed credit for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan -- an assertion that India has officially denied. Trump boasted that his administration used trade diplomacy to defuse tensions, famously quipping, “Let’s not trade nuclear missiles, let’s trade the things you make so beautifully.” He praised U.S. cabinet members like Marco Rubio and JD Vance for their involvement and asserted that millions of lives could have been lost had the conflict escalated. India has rebutted this claim, with the Ministry of External Affairs and Indian Army reiterating that the ceasefire was negotiated bilaterally through the DGMOs and that India’s military action was fully conventional. MEA also reaffirmed its long-standing position that Jammu & Kashmir is a bilateral issue and any resolution must begin with Pakistan vacating PoK.

Hindustan Times: [‘I said, let's not trade nuclear missiles…': Donald Trump repeats India-Pakistan ceasefire claim](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-said-lets-not-trade-nuclear-missiles-donald-trump-repeats-india-pakistan-ceasefire-claim-101747157362313.html) (14 May 2025)

But what’s more revealing than the claim itself is the worldview it implies. The U.S. appears to view India-Pakistan hostilities as an intra-civilisational conflict -- essentially, a disruptive sideshow in the broader strategic contest between the U.S. and Communist China. Kanti Bajpai, in *India Versus China*, underscores how India was structurally disadvantaged by Partition, which splintered its territorial, demographic, and economic heft. In contrast, China emerged from the 20th century with its imperial coherence largely intact. The U.S. wants India to focus squarely on this larger strategic threat -- China -- and not get bogged down in regional rivalries that risk derailing its economic rise and strategic partnership with the West. Seen from this angle, Trump’s message was not just peace-brokering theatre but strategic signalling: keep your eye on the real adversary. Trade was likely used as a lever in informal negotiations --- more stick than carrot for India -- bypassing formal channels, which may explain India’s official denials.

This also fits a historical pattern. As Kenton Clymer explains in *Quest for Freedom: The United States and India’s Independence*, the U.S. and Britain historically valued India not for its independence aspirations, but as a reservoir of manpower -- Sikhs, Rajputs, Muslims -- deployed in military campaigns across China, Indonesia, Vietnam, and beyond to protect imperial interests. Post-independence, India rejected this subservient role, adopting a neutralist foreign policy that often clashed with Western priorities. Pakistan, on the other hand, has consistently positioned itself as a pliant ally, willing to align with U.S. and Gulf Arab interests in exchange for strategic support. This strategic compliance buys it favour in Western and Arab capitals. It also explains why, despite clear evidence of cross-border terrorism, Pakistan has often succeeded in portraying itself as the victim. India’s cross-LoC strikes, though domestically justified as self-defence, were viewed externally as violations of sovereignty. In the end, both countries got diplomatically hyphenated again -- a situation Delhi loathes and Islamabad embraces for the strategic parity it confers.

The bottom line here is that we must  watch Trump’s remarks carefully -- not for their factual accuracy, but for the U.S. strategic mindset they reveal. The West, especially under Trump, will always prioritise great power competition with China over South Asian skirmishes. India must internalise this and choose its battles with that long-term game in

india,year,PSA: Beware when buying HDFC Health Insurance with Aggregate Deductible,"**TLDR:** Went for HDFC health insurance with a deductible to save on premium, but discovered a catch - no cashless claims allowed. Their sales rep first denied that there is such a clause, then backtracked completely. For those above 50, choosing a deductible is apparently permanent. Sharing this so you can make an informed choice.

I recently went insurance shopping for my parents and learned something that I think more people should know about.

Started with Ditto, who seemed pretty set on recommending just HDFC Ergo and Care. Fair enough, they're their partner companies - but when I asked about New India Assurance, they simply wouldn't discuss it. ""No tie-ups,"" they said. Despite New India Assurance having the best Claims Settlement Ratio and Claim Paid Ratio in the market ([according to the data published by IBAI)](https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/05/original/Screenshot_2024-12-01_165907_1733389318870.png), I still went ahead with Ditto's recommendations. Because my recent experience with a PSU bank for a home loan - with their excessive scrutiny and slow processing - made me wary of public sector companies. HDFC, on the other hand, had positive reviews and their policy looked good on paper. So I stuck with them.

I picked HDFC Ergo Optima Secure with a 50k aggregate deductible. For context, the premium for my 60-year-old father (no chronic pre-existing conditions) was 40k for 10L coverage. With the 50k deductible, it came down to 24k - a significant saving that made me lean towards taking the risk - I could handle 50k out of pocket, it's the bills that run into lakhs I want to protect against.

But then my Ditto advisor said something interesting: with a deductible, I should expect only reimbursement claims, not cashless, even at network hospitals. What's concerning is that this clause isn't explicitly mentioned anywhere in the brochures or policy documents - you'd never know unless someone tells you.

That sounded fishy, so I reached out to HDFC directly. Their sales rep was quick to dismiss this - ""No, no, that's just agents trying to get higher premiums!"" She even put it in writing when I asked for email confirmation. Then she started pushing me to buy directly through her instead of Ditto.

I decided to stick with Ditto - figured having an agent might help during claims. Insurance companies can be perfectly nice during sales, but I thought having someone to help during claims might be useful.

Then things got interesting. The very next day after I purchased the policy, the same HDFC rep sent another email completely contradicting her earlier statement. Turns out, policies with deductibles really are reimbursement-only. I guess she realized her written promise could come back to haunt her.

The Ditto advisor had also warned me about something crucial - for those above 50, once you choose a policy with a deductible, you're stuck with it forever. No switching back in future renewals, even if you're willing to pay more later. Again that's not something you'll be able to figure out from the brochures.

I'm now trying to cancel before the policy is fully issued (still waiting on telemedical verification). Ditto agreed to help with the cancellation, but naturally, they're not as quick with cancellations as they are with new sales.

The frustrating part is that I actually did my homework. Spent days researching, asked questions, got written confirmations - and still almost ended up with something different from what I thought I was buying.

If you're considering health insurance with a deductible, make sure you:

* Know exactly how your claims will be processed
* Understand that the deductible choice is permanent (for those above 50)
* Get everything in writing
* Double-check if the premium savings are worth the hassle
* Read between the lines - some crucial details might not be explicitly mentioned in policy documents

Would love to hear from others who've been through this process. How did you choose your insurance provider and policies? Any similar experiences to share?

india,year,The AI 171 crash and why aviation safety must remain above politics,"First and foremost, **my deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the AI171 tragedy, and to the people of Ahmedabad**. This is a heartbreaking moment for all those affected, and no discussion about policy, politics, or safety should take away from the grief and shock of this loss.

Given the tragedy that unfolded today, it is worth revisiting a broader, simmering concern.

According to the Times Aerospace (3 June 2025), Air India had recently scaled down its cooperation with Turkish Technic, it's partner for provisioning heavy maintenance services provider for its **wide-body aircraft specifically the Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner**, due to escalating geopolitical tensions between New Delhi and Ankara, in the wake of the recent Indo-Pak crisis. Turkey's vocal support for Paxtan on Kashmir reportedly triggered a political meltdown and a decision by AI to reroute heavy maintenance (MRO) operations to the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and the US. Air India CEO Campbell Wilson admitted this was in response to ""**national sentiment**,"" even though India lacks sufficient domestic capacity. Meanwhile, the DGCA has ordered IndiGo to terminate its wet lease of Turkish Airlines B777s by 31 August, and Turkish ground handler Celebi has had its security clearance revoked on national security grounds.

Times Aerospace: [Air India moves to sever MRO links with Turkiye](https://www.timesaerospace.aero/news/maintenance/air-india-moves-to-sever-mro-links-with-turkiye) (3 June 2025)  
Times of India: [Air India to shift maintenance work from Turkish firm as it 'looks to adjust plans' amid geopolitical tensions](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/air-india-to-shift-maintenance-work-from-turkish-firm-as-it-looks-to-adjust-plans-amid-geopolitical-tensions/articleshow/121552159.cms) (1 June 2025)

>Addressing questions regarding Air India’s ongoing use of Turkish Technic for wide-body aircraft maintenance, Wilson pointed to the global nature of aviation supply chains but underlined the airline’s responsiveness to geopolitical shifts and public sentiment. ""It does take a while to adjust when the circumstances change around us **but we are obviously sensitive to the national sentiment and perhaps the national wishes**. So, regardless of which country we are talking about, we would clearly take cognisance of what people like us to do and expect us to do,"" Wilson said in an interview with PTI.

I want to make it clear: I am not implying that this crash was caused by this recent MRO transition. Aircraft systems do not deteriorate that rapidly. However, it is absolutely critical to recognise what's at stake when geopolitical symbolism trumps commercial and engineering logic.

MRO, which stands for Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul, is not a luxury. It is the backbone of aviation safety. It involves routine inspections, major overhauls, part replacements, everything that keeps planes airworthy and safe. Turkish Technic is widely recognised as world-class in this domain. To disrupt such a tie not because of technical or commercial issues, but because of political pressure amidst diplomatic muscle-flexing, is deeply worrying. (While Air India likely maintains a diverse portfolio of MRO service providers, TT was a critical one, entrusted with the heavy maintenance of at least some of its premier wide-body aircraft, including the Dreamliner.)

The larger issue here is how political interference, and jingoistic aspirations can force detrimental commercial and engineering decisions. AI's hand was, in essence, forced. This was an airline already grappling with significant issues, as evidenced by the articles I have shared below, detailing problems ranging from an ageing fleet to difficulties sourcing spare parts. Political interference already exacerbated an already challenging situation, adding to mounting pressures, tight schedules, and unresolved safety questions, all amidst global supply chain disruptions, chronic labour shortages, and increasing geopolitical instability.

When jingoistic/ultranationalist sentiment is prioritised over established, globally recognised MRO expertise, especially when domestic capacity is openly acknowledged as insufficient (whither Atmanirbhar Bharat?), it creates a fundamental conflict between political objectives and the imperative of safety. The convergence of geopolitics, domestic politics, and commercial/operational stressors inevitably diminishes the overall resilience of the system. (And now who is to say what other domestic pressures Air India had been grappling with all this while?)

Ultimately, aviation safety must be treated as a non-negotiable imperative, one that is rigorously insulated from short-term political vacillations and fluctuations, or ultranationalist/jingoistic pressures imposed by far-right social media influencers for that matter.

india,year,Manipal Institute of Technology ( MAHE ) Bengaluru PhD Review – Harsh Truths from an Insider (2025),"I’m writing this in the hope that it pops up for anyone searching for Manipal Bengaluru PhD review, how is PhD in Manipal Bengaluru, MAHE Bengaluru PhD review, or anything close. If you’re even remotely thinking about starting your PhD at Manipal University Bangalore **(Manipal Institute of Technology, Bangalore)**, just stop and read this. I really wish I’d seen a post like this before signing up because honestly, things have gone downhill ever since I joined. I need advice, support, and honestly, I just want people to know what’s actually happening here before they make the same mistake I did.

First, if you have any other option any other university in India, literally anywhere else choose that. If you are somehow set on Manipal, **do yourself a favor and go to the main campus**. The Bangalore campus is not what you think it is. I can’t stress this enough.

What nobody tells you is that this **campus is basically just an undergrad college**. There are no master’s students, just bachelor’s, so you end up getting treated exactly like the 18-year-olds around you, no matter your age. It’s all about micromanagement they want to control when you have tea, when you eat, who you’re with, even how long you spend in the bathroom. It’s not a research environment, it’s not a workplace it’s like being back in a strict boarding school. If you imagined any academic freedom or even basic respect as a PhD, forget it. **Sometimes it feels more like an arts and sciences college than a serious engineering institute**.

The campus is so new, it feels like PhDs are just here for the professors to channel their frustrations, or to pad their publication records. There’s a real sense that we only exist so faculty can get more papers out and stick their names on our work, and many professors don’t even try to hide their disrespect for research scholars. I’ve been directly told by faculty that PhDs are a “loss-making entity,” that we should just know our place and not expect anything and be thankful for being allowed to use things without paying a huge fees.

On top of that, the **rules here are honestly humiliating.** There’s a biometric attendance system that requires you to be physically present on campus for at least **8.5 hours every day.** And that’s not enough you also have to sign registers. **If you’re even a minute late, you get an email sent to your entire department, including your supervisor, HOD, PhD coordinator, everyone, calling you out. They even threaten to cut your stipend for being one minute late**. I wish I was exaggerating, but I actually have the emails and screenshots to prove it. Imagine being a grown adult with a master’s degree, in your thirties, and getting this kind of treatment.

The location of the campus just makes everything worse. **It’s really far from the city, and if it rains, the approach roads get flooded**. Getting there and back is a nightmare, especially with the Bangalore traffic. Most of us spend at least 12 hours every day just to get to campus, stay for the mandatory 8.5 hours, and commute back home. And there’s no hostel or accommodation provided for PhD scholars, but you’re still expected to clock in full time every single day. The college bus is free for staff, but PhD students have to pay a ridiculous fee nearly 20,000 INR per semester just to get to the nearest bus stop. Most of us can’t afford that, so we end up cramming into shared autos or unreliable shuttles, which eats up even more of our time and energy.

**Then there’s the leave policy, which is honestly just cruel. You get only 12 casual leaves a year. No medical leave, no vacation, nothing else. If you take even a single extra day, not only will your stipend be cut, but your PhD duration gets extended.** And the process to get leave is such a bureaucratic mess that it feels like the process itself is the punishment. Compare this to almost any other private college in India, where PhDs get three or four times as much leave, plus vacation and medical leave. Here, the campus is open on most national holidays; we get only 12 holidays a year. Even if your supervisor is away on vacation for months, you’re still expected to sit on campus for 8.5 hours every day, doing nothing. For social science and management scholars, it’s even more ridiculous, because all their work is on laptops they don’t need a lab at all, and their own supervisors often say it’s a waste of time for them to be on campus. But the university still makes them come, and doesn’t provide cubicles, desks, or anything. We’re told to just find a place maybe a library seat, maybe a classroom, whatever and somehow do research from there.

What’s really clear is that Manipal Bangalore is just a business. Every single person on campus, from the pro-vice-chancellor to the security guard to the clerks, acts like you’re just a cog in their money-making machine. The only thing that matters is pumping out research papers and making the university look good. They do not care about your mental health, your physical health, your personal life, nothing. You’re just a number, and the more you publish, the happier they are. As for the so-called research leadership, the Head of Research for this campus has an h-index of 5. That’s the person supposed to be guiding us. That says everything about the priorities here.

If you’re reading this and searching for Manipal Bengaluru PhD review or MAHE PhD review, please, please do your own research. Talk to current scholars (not just professors or admissions people), visit the labs, read every policy and guideline on the website line by line before you decide anything. Don’t get fooled by the shiny prospectus or the “world-class” marketing talk. I really regret coming here. I’ve even considered quitting, but the department says I’ll have to pay back my entire stipend or they’ll take legal action. This place drains your motivation and your mental health, and I honestly understand why student mental health is so bad here and in so many Indian universities.

I’m just sharing my experience in the hope that at least one person will see it and think twice. If you care about your research, your well-being, or even your basic dignity, think long and hard before you join Manipal Bangalore for your PhD. This is not the place for anyone who wants a healthy academic life. I wish I had known all this before it would have saved me so much pain.",126,16,2025-05-22,Shoddy-Tip4810,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ksikp8/manipal_institute_of_technology_mahe_bengaluru/,manipal institute of technology mahe bengaluru phd review harsh

india,year,India is betting on nuclear energy. Can it also help reverse brain drain and create innovation hubs?,"India’s interest in nuclear energy isn’t new—but it seems to be entering a new phase. From expanding our reactor fleet to finally pushing ahead with thorium research, we’re one of the few countries taking the long-term view on nuclear, even as others hesitate.

And that makes me wonder—

We train some of the best engineers and scientists in the world. IITs, IISERs, and NITs get lakhs in state investment per student. But once they graduate? Many leave—either because of lack of opportunity, poor research infrastructure, or simply better pay abroad.

But nuclear isn’t just “one more sector.” It’s a convergence point for high-level science, engineering, national strategy, and long-term vision. It involves:

Advanced materials, radiation shielding, robotics

Control systems, nuclear computing, data modeling

Fusion research, thorium reactors, isotope engineering

Spinoff fields like medical isotopes, industrial applications, and even space systems


Which brings me to the open question:

> Why isn’t India’s nuclear push also becoming an innovation hub for our top minds?
Could it be a natural foundation for a new kind of “Indian Silicon Valley”—not for startups, but for deep-tech R&D and strategic manufacturing?



I don’t have a perfect proposal. I’m not pitching “let’s do this.”
But I wonder:

What’s holding us back? Is it bureaucracy? Lack of international collaboration? Risk aversion?

Can the government play a bigger role—not just in policy, but in setting up actual industries or R&D hubs with salaries that compete globally?

Could our nuclear focus become a magnet for those who now leave India for advanced research or better labs?


I’d love to hear thoughts—critical, practical, or visionary.
Maybe nuclear isn’t the right space. Maybe there’s a better model. But if we can’t build indigenous innovation in something as strategic, government-backed, and tech-intensive as nuclear, where can we?

(Not an expert, just curious. Open to being corrected or learning more.)

Note: I understand there are many systemic issues and frustrations, and they're valid. But this thread isn’t meant to be a place for hopeless venting.
Instead, I’m hoping we can focus on potential paths forward—especially in fields like nuclear, space, or research—where India might still have a shot.
If you're cynical, that's fair—but please consider offering an alternative, or at least a constructive perspective.",27,28,2025-05-15,Yamantakks,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1kn3s4e/india_is_betting_on_nuclear_energy_can_it_also/,india is betting on nuclear energy can it also help reverse brain drain and create innovation hubs,indias interest in nuclear energy isnt newbut it seems to be entering a new phase from expanding our reactor fleet to finally pushing ahead with thorium research were one of the few countries taking the longterm view on nuclear even as others hesitate and that makes me wonder we train some of the best engineers and scientists in the world iits iisers and nits get lakhs in state investment per student but once they graduate many leaveeither because of lack of opportunity poor research infrastructure or simply better pay abroad but nuclear isnt just one more sector its a convergence point for highlevel science engineering national strategy and longterm vision it involves advanced materials radiation shielding robotics control systems nuclear computing data modeling fusion research thorium reactors isotope engineering spinoff fields like medical isotopes industrial applications and even space systems which brings me to the open question why isnt indias nuclear push also becoming an innovation hub for our top minds could it be a natural foundation for a new kind of indian silicon valleynot for startups but for deeptech rd and strategic manufacturing i dont have a perfect proposal im not pitching lets do this but i wonder whats holding us back is it bureaucracy lack of international collaboration risk aversion can the government play a bigger rolenot just in policy but in setting up actual industries or rd hubs with salaries that compete globally could our nuclear focus become a magnet for those who now leave india for advanced research or better labs id love to hear thoughtscritical practical or visionary maybe nuclear isnt the right space maybe theres a better model but if we cant build indigenous innovation in something as strategic governmentbacked and techintensive as nuclear where can we not an expert just curious open to being corrected or learning more note i understand there are many systemic issues and frustrations and theyre valid but this thread isnt meant to be a place for hopeless venting instead im hoping we can focus on potential paths forwardespecially in fields like nuclear space or researchwhere india might still have a shot if youre cynical thats fairbut please consider offering an alternative or at least a constructive perspective,india betting nuclear energy also help reverse brain drain create innovation hubs,indias interest nuclear energy isnt newbut seems entering new phase expanding reactor fleet finally pushing ahead thorium research one countries taking longterm view nuclear even others hesitate makes wonder train best engineers scientists world iits iisers nits get lakhs state investment per student graduate many leaveeither lack opportunity poor research infrastructure simply better pay abroad nuclear isnt one sector convergence point highlevel science engineering national strategy longterm vision involves advanced materials radiation shielding robotics control systems nuclear computing data modeling fusion research thorium reactors isotope engineering spinoff fields like medical isotopes industrial applications even space systems brings open question isnt indias nuclear push also becoming innovation hub top minds could natural foundation new kind indian silicon valleynot startups deeptech rd strategic manufacturing dont perfect proposal im pitching lets wonder whats holding us back bureaucracy lack international collaboration risk aversion government play bigger rolenot policy setting actual industries rd hubs salaries compete globally could nuclear focus become magnet leave india advanced research better labs id love hear thoughtscritical practical visionary maybe nuclear isnt right space maybe theres better model cant build indigenous innovation something strategic governmentbacked techintensive nuclear expert curious open corrected learning note understand many systemic issues frustrations theyre valid thread isnt meant place hopeless venting instead im hoping focus potential paths forwardespecially fields like nuclear space researchwhere india might still shot youre cynical thats fairbut please consider offering alternative least constructive perspective,False,-0.04517991840839386,Neutral,Real Text
india,year,"House Demolitions, Pseudo-Patriotic Rhetoric Can’t Hide Modi Govt’s Broken Security Policy at Pahalgam","For the past 24 hours, the Narendra Modi government has worked frantically on two fronts to stop the people of India from asking pointed, logical questions about the security and political failures that allowed six heavily armed terrorists to gun down 26 innocent civilians at the Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam, Kashmir on April 22.

These failings are manifest. The government spent the past five years claiming the threat of terrorism had receded thanks to its decision to abrogate Article 370 in August 2019. Then it said its ‘surgical strikes’ on terrorist camps in Pakistan would serve as a deterrent. To present a picture of ‘normalcy’, it allowed tourists to gather in a vulnerable, inaccessible place without the presence of even basic security. None of this absolves the terrorists of their crime, of course, but the prime minister’s complacency cannot also be wished away.

So how has his government tried to cover its tracks? First, by blaming the people of India for not loving their country enough. “Until 140 crore Indians don’t make nationalism and patriotism their supreme duty (‘param dharm‘), these types of incidents will continue to trouble the country,” Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal told reporters on Friday. Of course, Modi was smart enough to convey this noxious theory via a politically expendable acolyte in case it backfires.

The second move the government has made is to emulate the Israeli tactic of inflicting collective punishment on poor Kashmiri families for the alleged sins of their black sheep. Israel routinely does this to the Palestinians, who are, in the eyes of international law, an Occupied people. But Modi has no compunctions rendering dozens of his own fellow citizens homeless—the elderly, children, women—so long as he gets to avoid being blamed for his hubris and incompetence in claiming a premature victory over terrorism.

In demolishing home after home, however, he has exposed not just his own contempt for the rule of law—as recently reiterated by the Supreme Court—but also the discriminatory nature of official policy in which the religion of terror victims and of their attackers determines how the state will respond.",67,20,2025-04-27,opinion_discarder,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1k913t2/house_demolitions_pseudopatriotic_rhetoric_cant/,house demolitions pseudopatriotic rhetoric cant hide modi govts broken security policy at pahalgam,for the past hours the narendra modi government has worked frantically on two fronts to stop the people of india from asking pointed logical questions about the security and political failures that allowed six heavily armed terrorists to gun down innocent civilians at the baisaran meadow in pahalgam kashmir on april these failings are manifest the government spent the past five years claiming the threat of terrorism had receded thanks to its decision to abrogate article in august then it said its surgical strikes on terrorist camps in pakistan would serve as a deterrent to present a picture of normalcy it allowed tourists to gather in a vulnerable inaccessible place without the presence of even basic security none of this absolves the terrorists of their crime of course but the prime ministers complacency cannot also be wished away so how has his government tried to cover its tracks first by blaming the people of india for not loving their country enough until crore indians dont make nationalism and patriotism their supreme duty param dharm these types of incidents will continue to trouble the country union commerce minister piyush goyal told reporters on friday of course modi was smart enough to convey this noxious theory via a politically expendable acolyte in case it backfires the second move the government has made is to emulate the israeli tactic of inflicting collective punishment on poor kashmiri families for the alleged sins of their black sheep israel routinely does this to the palestinians who are in the eyes of international law an occupied people but modi has no compunctions rendering dozens of his own fellow citizens homelessthe elderly children womenso long as he gets to avoid being blamed for his hubris and incompetence in claiming a premature victory over terrorism in demolishing home after home however he has exposed not just his own contempt for the rule of lawas recently reiterated by the supreme courtbut also the discriminatory nature of official policy in which the religion of terror victims and of their attackers determines how the state will respond,house demolitions pseudopatriotic rhetoric cant hide modi govts broken security policy pahalgam,past hours narendra modi government worked frantically two fronts stop people india asking pointed logical questions security political failures allowed six heavily armed terrorists gun innocent civilians baisaran meadow pahalgam kashmir april failings manifest government spent past five years claiming threat terrorism receded thanks decision abrogate article august said surgical strikes terrorist camps pakistan would serve deterrent present picture normalcy allowed tourists gather vulnerable inaccessible place without presence even basic security none absolves terrorists crime course prime ministers complacency cannot also wished away government tried cover tracks first blaming people india loving country enough crore indians dont make nationalism patriotism supreme duty param dharm types incidents continue trouble country union commerce minister piyush goyal told reporters friday course modi smart enough convey noxious theory via politically expendable acolyte case backfires second move government made emulate israeli tactic inflicting collective punishment poor kashmiri families alleged sins black sheep israel routinely palestinians eyes international law occupied people modi compunctions rendering dozens fellow citizens homelessthe elderly children womenso long gets avoid blamed hubris incompetence claiming premature victory terrorism demolishing home home however exposed contempt rule lawas recently reiterated supreme courtbut also discriminatory nature official policy religion terror victims attackers determines state respond,False,-0.627769947052002,Negative,Real Text
india,year,Re-evaluation of the China-Russia-India relationship,"I don't know if this has been posted earlier but after the Operation Sindhoor and political upcomings. India needs to seriously think of its diplomatic policy towards China. 

China outright came out in support of Pak and went harsh on India. Thanks to the Chinese jersey being used by the Paks, Chinese CCP bots did it's best role to demean India during this conflict. This is very much akin to the 71 scenario where China overlooked a genocide happening in its neighbourhood blinded by its hate towards India. 

China is an economic megapower Today and India is far away from achieving such economic success, yet the CCP has continuously peddled.   "" India is a threat "" amongst the Chinese. Meanwhile Indians are making reels on insta showing Chinese jets blah blah and comparing them to Indian political incompetency. China also condemned the Indus Water treaty abrogation and called it an act of war. 

USSR had a long standing policy of maintaining distance from the Chinese, but it's broken by Putin now thanks to his war in Ukraine. Seems like Russia is a puppet to them now. We are completely left with no allies in Asia ( honestly we never had ). Is this a failure of India diplomacy of neutraity again ? Bureaucrartic mess or present government 's thinking??

india,year,"We were taught India’s geography is the best, but is it really?","Growing up, we were all told by our teachers that India has the best geography in the world because of its three distinct seasons and natural barriers like the Himalayas and the Indian Ocean. It sounded great on paper, but when we compare it to countries like the USA, it’s clear that our geography isn’t as perfect as we were led to believe.

One of the biggest issues we face is dust accumulation, which isn’t just due to construction but also natural factors. Desert winds from the Middle East bring fine sand particles, and the Himalayas trap them in India instead of letting them disperse further north. On top of that, our long dry seasons and intense heat keep dust circulating in the air for months, unlike in countries that have regular rain or snowfall to clear it out.

Another major issue is pollution from neighboring countries, which worsens air quality in India, especially in the north. Unlike the USA, which has no immediate hostile neighbors polluting its air, India constantly deals with industrial emissions and environmental mismanagement from across its borders. The lack of urban planning also makes dust and pollution harder to control in Indian cities. Unlike the USA, which has peaceful neighbors like Canada and Mexico, India is surrounded by countries like Pakistan, China, and even Bangladesh, where environmental mismanagement, industrial pollution, and cross-border instability directly affect us.

Now, looking at the USA, it seems like they have near-perfect geographical conditions moderate climate, winters that naturally clear pollutants, a good balance of rainfall and vegetation, and better infrastructure to manage urban dust. Meanwhile, India struggles with a combination of natural factors and poor environmental policies, making dust and pollution a daily part of life.

So yeah, while our geography has its advantages, it’s definitely not the best in the world like we were taught.

india,year,Perspective of a Pakistani on Pehalgam incident,"First of all my deepest condolences  on the inhuman tragedy that occurred. 

These radicals and terrorists are not at all Muslims as Islam doesn't allow to kill innocent civilians under any circumstances. 
This is pure terrorism and should be condemned regardless of nationality or religion. 

Your hatred towards Pakistan is kinda justifiable because of all the history between us. 
However we Pakistani doesn't feel the same for at least the India and it's people

My ancestors belong to Indore and Agra and i still proudly tell my ethnicity is from UP (United Province) 

Same goes for if any Indian gets a chance to visit Pakistan he will be loved alot as we consider Indian people as our brothers (see yatri doctor, Vikrant guptas visit) 

Now coming to my question to all intellectual people here is as follows 
Also let me clear one more thing i hate the Pak Army leadership due to their involvement in domestic affairs and their corrupt practices so my assessment is without any bias

1. Let's assume it was indeed done by Pak Military isn't that make your government or Military accountable 
As for example if some terrorist attack happens in Pakistan we generally blame it on the security agencies as how did they were able to penetrate

Now in this particular incident India's claim is terrorist cross the border (what is BSF doing)
They come inside 150kms (where are the checkpoints)

Considering Kashmir is the heavily military area in the world with 600,000 troops it is no less than a shame that such incident happened that too on touristy spot

If your Army is competent enough then how are Pak army is successful in these endeavours 

2. In Pakistan when BLA (balochistan) does terrorists activities we condemn them and call them terrorists but we also raise questions what circumstances made them terrorists and why there is a local support 

And we blame the government and establishment policies about balochistan as the root cause of the problem

Why Indians don't ask the same question why there is local support to these terrorists what did we do wrong with Kashmiris

It isn't as plain as Muslim or Hindus there has to be some bigger problem if which addressed there would be no local terrorist support 


These terrorists work on Narrative and if there is no sense of deprivation there is no more breeding grounds for terrorism

Then no matter how much Pakistani Army will try the local population will never support these scumbags 

So the focus should be fixing your own country instead of boasting about wiping out whole country and cities


This is also a terrorist mentality to wipe out cities as if there are no innocent civilians in it

I hope common sense prevail in both our countries and i pray God give some brain to our fauj. 

With that being said it doesn't mean in case of any external attacks we Pakistani won't stand united with our Army
We will fight till the last breath regardless of our love and hate relationship with the army. 

Peace out

india,year,"Aadhaar Update scam Nightmare: Valid Proof Rejected, Grievance Closed, RTI Filed Against UIDAI","After exhausting every possible option to update my Aadhaar address, I’ve finally filed an RTI against UIDAI. Here's my experience and why I chose to take this step:

I had submitted a **domicile certificate** issued by a competent authority, which is clearly listed as a **valid Proof of Address (PoA)** on UIDAI’s own website. Yet, my **first application was rejected**, stating ""invalid proof of address"". I paid **₹50** again and re-applied with the same document. This time, they responded with a generic message asking me to **enrol offline at a Kendra**, without giving any reason for rejecting a valid document.

I did everything I could —

* Sent emails
* Raised grievances on the **CPGRAMS** portal by PMO
* Appealed again when the grievance was closed without resolution

Yet nothing worked. No one looked into the actual document submitted or gave a meaningful reply.

While I could have easily paid an agent ₹200–₹300 to get this done through the backdoor, I chose to follow the official process — **the honest way** — and this is the price I paid.

Even though one person's stand might not change the system, I still decided to take that stand.

---

### Here's what I asked in my RTI (under Section 6(1) of the RTI Act):

1. **Total number of Aadhaar update applications** received across India between **01 January 2025 and 30 May 2025**.
2. **Number of applications rejected** for the reason ""Invalid Proof of Address"" during the same period (state-wise or region-wise, if available).
3. Is a **domicile certificate** issued by a competent government authority **officially listed as a valid PoA** under UIDAI policy?
4. What are the **guidelines or SOPs** given to Aadhaar Seva Kendra staff and validators for verifying a domicile certificate?
5. What is UIDAI’s **grievance redressal process** for complaints filed via CPGRAMS? Are officials **required to verify documents** attached with the complaint?
6. How many complaints were **re-verified and reversed** by UIDAI (due to valid documents being rejected) between Jan–May 2025?
7. Are there any **internal reviews, audits, or third-party evaluations** of Aadhaar update rejections to check for wrongful rejections?
8. What **action is taken against officials** or systems that reject valid applications without reason?
9. Who is **held accountable** when applicants are wrongly rejected, causing financial loss, delay, and stress?
10. In how many such cases has UIDAI **refunded the ₹50 update fee** after wrongful rejection?

---

I sincerely hope this RTI sheds some light on the **lack of accountability** in the Aadhaar update process. The system is broken — and unless more people speak up, it will remain that way.

If you’ve faced a similar issue, please share your story. Let’s make these inefficiencies public.

india,year,The cesspool of hypocrisy that has permeated the privileged urban middle and upper-middle classes in our country.,"This is a very long rant/post, but I just wanted this out of my system. I just couldn't take it anymore with my relatives, and the people I am surrounded by and their hypocrisy. There is no TLDR. Use ChatGpt if you need to, or ignore the post.

-------

A couple of months ago, I had an interesting conversation with my uncle. He was praising the government left and right because of how the Vande Bharat trains are changing the face of the Indian Railways by bringing in world-class, if not beyond world-class, level of travel to India. 

***'Aur kya chahiye? Look at the development!'***

Fast forward to the present, he and the rest of my privileged family are engaged in a conversation spewing vitriol, and classist & casteist rage at the people vandalizing the trains in North India. Labels such as 'uncivilized', 'gawaars', 'chapri', and more are freely being plastered on these people. It is happening in social media too. Videos of overcrowded compartments and passengers storming into reserved coaches have become viral with most of the privileged section of our society seeing this as nothing more than the unruly behavior of uncivilized villagers. There are even questions about our taxes being wasted on the RPF and GRP and whatnot letting our country 'descend into lawlessness.'

Let us step back for a moment and look at this situation from a different perspective. These privileged people venting out their frustration with the overcrowded trains is not unfounded, but the way they are doing it reveals a deeper layer of their psyche. Instead of holding the government responsible [for cutting general and sleeper coaches](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/railways-indian-railways-goes-premium-with-more-ac-coaches-per-train-key-details-inside-3417508/) while prioritizing 'world-class' premium services like Vande Bharat trains, they direct their rage at [people who have no options.](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/soaring-train-fares-shrinking-sleeper-coaches-add-to-passenger-woes/article67545165.ece) The outrage isn't just about the congestion. It is about having to share a space with people they think don't belong there.

My relatives, especially that uncle, who rarely travels by train have the audacity to talk about second-hand embarrassment over these incidents, all while keeping mum on [the policies that created this situation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/indian-railways-on-the-wrong-track-darjeeling-train-accident-balasore-triple-tragedy-passenger-safety-kavach/article68362231.ece). The same bhakts whining about the 'lawlessness' now, never once spoke about the reduction of the general coaches, [the lack of safety](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/analysis-rail-safety-off-track-as-train-incidents-surge-6793663), [the fucking selfie booths of our baby](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-spent-162-cr-on-pms-3d-selfie-photo-booths-across-50-railway-stations-says-rti-reply/article67676762.ece). They remained silent while the ticket prices shot up and the people who can barely afford it are not even ensured basic dignity.

This outrage about 'lawlessness' and lack of safety never was a point of concern when Sanghi mobs, backed by the state, [were attacking people in broad daylight](https://scroll.in/article/1062772/they-saw-a-muslim-name-and-attacked-how-hindutva-mobs-ran-amok-on-mira-road), [lynching people](https://www.thehindu.com/specials/text-and-context/states-lax-response-to-lynching/article67138604.ece), [enforcing caste hierarchy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/up-rajasthan-mp-top-in-cases-of-atrocities-on-dalits-report/article68670887.ece) and [violence through religious terror](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-58406194). The only time they suddenly become aware of 'law and order' is when the same people who were handed impunity by the government, to do whatever they want began disrupting their own comfort. When these same groups go about [attacking interfaith couples](https://cjp.org.in/2024-love-jihad-as-a-socio-political-tool-caste-endogamy-and-hindutvas-dominance-over-gender-and-social-boundaries-in-india/l), [spreading terror in the name of culture and religion](https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/rising-tide-of-atrocities-against-dalits-2850523), and more, they do not cry for 'civic sense.' But when these people start breaking rules in their spaces, whether it is AC trains, malls, or gated communities, then it suddenly becomes a problem. Like their pawpaw says, 'Hypocrisy ki bhi seema hoti hain.'

The government's obsession with Vande Bharat and the bullet train shows how messed up their priorities are. These trains are turned into an event with the prime baby of our country being hyped up so much as if he himself built these trains with his own hands. When incidents like these happen, the news media will be silent and these bhakts will say 'You expect him to take care of everything?' These idiots don't realize that the government is doing nothing to solve the problems of the majority of the population. These lodus have spent more than a decade excusing and even justifying policies that strip the underprivileged of basic dignity. Failures of the state are treated as 'minor inconveniences' while blaming those most affected by them or demonizing oppressed communities. The state of despair we are in is because when they had to demand accountability, they chose to defend the people in power. It is easy to shit on the desperation of the poor on social media from the comfort of your home, but it takes willful ignorance to turn a blind eye to the people who put them in that situation.

To clarify, I am not saying that the vandalism by the people attacking the trains is justified, but I feel they are not doing this *only* out of unruliness, but also because the system has given them no choice. General coaches are packed to the brim, trains are running hours behind schedule, and sanitation is non-existent, but ***'Woh dekho! Bullet train.'***

Unsurprisingly, both groups (the ones whining about uncivilized people, and the ones engaging in vandalism), remain among the government's most loyal supporters. They tirelessly make excuses, spread disinformation, defend the government's blatant anti-poor policies, etc. Both groups have been convinced that 'Something good is happening somewhere. It may not be happening to or around me, but it is happening.' My neighbor, who was in tears when the Hindus in Bangladesh were being attacked and killed, is silent about his Hindu brothers and sisters in the Kumbh Mela. He is silent about the government quietly brushing that and the Delhi station stampede under the rug.

The state has provided both these groups with plenty of enemies — minorities, oppressed communities, intellectuals, or anyone who questions the government. The politicians have successfully created an environment of 'Us vs Them' while they happily fill their coffers and give themselves and their families and friends a grand life.",72,17,2025-02-16,MaskedManiac92,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ir3dxj/the_cesspool_of_hypocrisy_that_has_permeated_the/,the cesspool of hypocrisy that has permeated the privileged

india,year,A common mistakes in the reasoning behind caste based reservation.,"There's a common argument that caste based reservation is for representation of backward castes. It's not for ""educational, economic, social advancement"" of the caste.

This is not completely true. 

**The summary is**- reservation in jobs and promotions - for representation of the caste.

Reservation in educational institutions - for advancement of the caste. 

**More detail regarding this** - 

1) **Reservation in educational institutions** - it is by article 15(4) and 15(5).

This is written in article 15(5)- ""Nothing in this article or in sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of article 19 shall prevent the State from making any special provision, by law, for the **advancement** of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes in so far as such special provisions relate to their admission to educational institutions including private educational institutions""

So, reservations in enrollment to academic institutions is for advancement/progress of the socially and educationally backward classes or sc/st.

https://indiankanoon.org/doc/609295/

Also, article 15(4) was introduced in the first constitutional amendment.

This is written in the object and reasons of the first constitutional amendment - ""It is laid down in article 46 as a directive principle of State policy that the State should **promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and protect them from social injustice**. In order that any special provision that the State may make **for the educational, economic or social advancement** of any backward class of citizens may not be challenged on the ground of being discriminatory, it is proposed that article 15(3) should be suitably amplified""

https://www.india.gov.in/my-government/constitution-india/amendments/constitution-india-first-amendment-act-1951

2) **Reservation in jobs and promotions** - it is by article 16(4)-

This is written in article 16(4)- ""Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is **not adequately represented in the services under the State**.""

So, reservation in jobs and promotions is for adequate representation of the caste in the job. https://indiankanoon.org/doc/211089/

india,year,Why is language an issue throughout India(especially southern)? Read the body text too.,"The outrage towards the compulsory 3rd language policy in schools is understandable. But why do people want other states' people in their state to learn their languages? The major thing I hear is if the other states' person is in a customer facing profession, then they should learn the local language. My question is, why? If they can manage to earn their living without speaking the local language then why should they learn it? Obviously some locals won't be able to make use of their service because of a language barrier, but then the customer can go to another place and it would be the ot(other state) person's loss.
Just make sure kids learn their mother tongues and use that to converse at home. That should be good enough to preserve the language. 2 parents -> 2 kids, the number of local language speakers remains the same.
And people in India unite on a larger scale to 'fight' against bigger oppositions and then this pseudo unity crumbles into factions based on the smaller version of the larger conflict. For eg. It was(is) South Indian languages vs Hindi, then 1 statement by an actor(and minister) and now it's Kannada vs Tamil (a conflict within South India). 

Indians should learn to do things for what they support, instead of wanting others to do it. Which in this case is, teach your kids your mother tongues. For an eg. I've lived almost all of my life in Mumbai, Bellary, Hyderabad and Bangalore. All the kids in my societies spoke English, at all these places. It may be different in rural areas, but in top Indian cities, parents chase elitism with english and forget to teach their kids their mother tongues (happened with me too I guess). One of the reasons might be cross cultural parents, which prompted a common language to be spoken at home(which was my case), but I know way too many people who can't speak or write their own mother tongues even though their parents speak that. And I know many parents too who haven't their kids their mother tongues and speak exclusively in English.

india,year,From the Fence to the Right: Why I Couldn’t Stand the Left’s Hypocrisy Anymore,"I used to sit on the fence, not really knowing where I stood politically. I wasn’t too far left, nor did I think right-wing was the answer. But, over time, the constant negativity, hatred, and downright hostility from the so called “liberal” crowd pushed me away. These are the people who once stood for open-mindedness and freedom of speech, but now it’s like if you don't agree with them, you're the enemy. They’ve gone from being liberal or leaning left to this extreme, almost radical side, and it's dangerous. Anything that doesn't fit their narrative gets thrown out, no discussion, just rejected.

I didn’t move to the right because I think BJP is perfect. Hell, I know they have their flaws. But when you compare them to the current opposition? There’s no contest. The opposition whether it’s Congress or others have no real vision. All they do is oppose Modi and BJP no matter what the issue is. They don’t have any solid plan or leadership, just pure anti-Modi, anti-BJP hatred. It’s like they’re focused on destroying something rather than building anything.

BJP, despite its faults, has actually done a lot. I’m not going to sit here and pretend they haven’t messed up I mean, look at how they caved during the farm laws protests. Instead of sticking to their guns and pushing through much-needed reforms, they bent the knee and gave in. That said, Modi’s government has done well on multiple fronts. Economic reforms, foreign policy, Digital India these aren’t just slogans. India has grown on the global stage, and stuff like Make in India and infrastructure developments are hard to ignore. Even with COVID, they managed better than expected, despite all the criticism.

But what really made me turn away from the left was the extremism in these echo chambers, especially places like anti-India subReddits. These spaces are filled with people just repeating the same hateful stuff over and over again. They don’t want a discussion, they just want validation for their views. Anything that challenges them gets shut down, downvoted, or ignored. It’s a closed loop of negativity, where nothing new can break through. That's not liberalism, it's just a toxic, biased bubble.

It’s dangerous to live like that, constantly feeding on your own hatred. You end up so trapped in your views, you can’t see anything else. I’d honestly tell people who are stuck in these echo chambers to step out for once. Look at the other side, see how things actually are. The same goes for rightwingers everyone needs to take a break from the bubble and try to see both perspectives.

In the end, I moved right because at least the BJP is trying to govern, even if they screw up sometimes. It’s better than the left, which is just consumed by hatred, negativity, and shutting down anything that doesn’t match their narrow views.


Edit** Wow, everyone's really outdoing themselves just as I predicted. Doubling down on their echo chambers and attacking any other perspective like it’s their muscle memory.

india,year,Advice on toxic Partner (India Big 4),"I recently joined a Big 4 firm in India as a consultant, primarily working in policy and core consulting. While I genuinely enjoy my sector and the consulting work itself, I’m struggling with a toxic work environment—specifically, a difficult partner.

A week ago, I was assigned to attend a seven-hour-long roundtable conference online. My task was to capture key points from the discussion while simultaneously creating a PowerPoint presentation that needed to be displayed almost immediately after each two-hour session. Given the nature of the task, it was nearly impossible to take detailed meeting minutes while also preparing slides in real time. All this was communicated by a consultant ( working with a manager).

I did so while the manager was actively seeing what I was doing and instructing me on PPT preparation.

Yesterday, the partner called me into his office and harshly criticized my work. All the blame was soley on me while the manager is basically not even critised that this was not upto his standards. This partner is never in a mood to listena as any time I say anything, the angrier he became. Eventually, the pressure and frustration overwhelmed me, and I ended up crying in his cabin—something that left me feeling embarrassed.

This isn’t the first time this has happened. I’ve only been officially a consultant for three months (six months including my internship experience in the same team), but internal mobility isn’t allowed until 18 months, meaning I still have 15 months before I can even consider moving internally.

I truly love my field and enjoy consulting, but the toxicity in this environment is making it difficult for me to continue. I feel stuck and don’t know how to navigate this situation. I’d really appreciate some advice.

india,year,India’s Local Governance is a Mess. Here’s How We Can Fix It,"I’ve been thinking a lot about how unnecessarily complicated India’s governance structure is. We have districts, tehsils, blocks, mandals, panchayats, municipalities, and municipal corporations, all overlapping and creating a bureaucratic nightmare. Who is responsible for what? No one knows. This system was created from colonial times, and it needs to be reformed

**The Problem**

* A district has its own commissioner, medical officer, fire service, etc. but at the same time, multiple districts can overlap with a municipality.
* Rural areas are even worse – a single village has to deal with a gram panchayat, a block officer, a tehsil officer, and the district administration, all at the same time.
* Big cities are just as bad. Eg: The BMC in Mumbai handles roads and waste, the state government controls transport and policing, and district officers manage revenue. Too many departments, zero accountability.

**The Solution: A Simple, Three-Tier System-**

Instead of having so many overlapping layers, why not just have three clear levels?

1. Central Government – Handles national issues like defense, foreign policy, taxation, and inter-state matters.
2. State Government – Responsible for state policing, healthcare, education, and state-level infrastructure.
3. Local Government-

a) Municipal Corporations (Big Cities) – Fully autonomous, handling transport, housing, waste, water, policing, and taxation.

b) Municipalities (Small Towns) – Similar to municipal corporations but on a smaller scale.

c) District Governments (For Rural Areas) – One elected district government replaces blocks, tehsils, and panchayats, handling healthcare, schools, roads, sanitation, and economic development.

**Funding for Local Governments-**

One of the biggest problems in India is that local governments don’t have financial independence. They rely on states for funding. That's why there a should a new finance bill that states the following:

1. 10% of the central government’s gross tax revenue should go as devolution to local governments.
2. 35% of the central government’s gross tax revenue should go as devolution to state governments.
3. 25% of a state’s own tax revenue should go as devolution to local governments within that state.

This would ensure that local governments have guaranteed funding and won't have to rely on the state or center for grants. This would also give the local governments financial autonomy

**Outcomes-**

1. More Accountability – If something isn’t working in your city or district, you know exactly who is responsible.
2. Less Corruption & Wastage – Removing unnecessary layers will save billions of rupees every year.
3. Faster Decision-Making – No more endless approvals from multiple departments.
4. Better Local Services – Cities and districts get direct funding, improving governance.

**How Can This Be Implemented-**

1. Pilot Projects in 1-2 states – Merge tehsils, blocks, and panchayats into district governments and see how it works.
2. Amend the Constitution – Modify 73rd & 74th Amendments to officially restructure local governance.
3. Expand nationwide in phases – Implement it gradually over 5-10 years.

**Note-**

Most countries don’t have this many administrative layers. This confusing system in India only creates inefficiency, confusion, and corruption. For Eg: US only has Federal, state, county/municipal governments

Is it possible to push for such a reform?",33,12,2025-03-04,OwlProfessional9656,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1j3ctbo/indias_local_governance_is_a_mess_heres_how_we/,indias local governance

india,year,My observations as an ABCD visiting India after a gap of 10 years,"My background:  
Visiting after a decade.

**The Positives:**

1. Crime in India is EXTREMELY overrated in most metros when compared to population. People returned my iPhone 16 pro max 1 TB on a crowded city bus. Crime is practically nonexistent for the affluent. If you're reading this and are scared to go to India... you have nothing to be scared of in any major city even as a single woman. Just use common sense. The tenderloin in SF is much more dangerous.
2. The kindness of the average Indian is supreme. Not a single negative incident, everyone has been exceptionally kind.
3. Even street sellers will return exact change and will refuse any pity on them. Everyone wants to EARN their money.
4. There's a vibrant local nightlife scene that's very distinct from the global one. This was the best part. Every other nightlife scene in the world is the more or less the same but India is the only place where your local club will have penn masala level talent playing Bollywood/Tollywood/Kollywood bangers at corner bar with lights/fog machines etc.
5. There's a vibrant comedy/poetry scene on top with EXTREMELY charismatic talent.
6. Level of service is unmatched anywhere. Food won't get just come to you but they'll put it on your plate and even feed it to you... if you want.
7. Food per price point is unmatched, and much more flavorful.
8. No one really gives a fuck about religion. Muslims don't even care about Modi or think about him. Sure they're opposed to his policies but most couldn't even tell you what policies those are. Everyone just votes as per their community but religion isn't a point of friction  as its shown in the news. I went to a dargah, a temple, a church... everyone just does their thing, takes it seriously but no religious tensions ever flare up. The liberal media is lying to you. India is peaceful as fuck. No hindu nationalism... no fasicm. No one really gives a fuck and everyone is hustling to get by.
9. People just don't become aggressive here compared to white people or black people. Everyone gets along somehow and even when they seem to fight... people just want to move on with their day quickly after hurling a few insults.
10. People look out for each other. Even beggars know they'll survive because people are kind here. America is a country of outliers... it hates dumb/lazy/poor/unambitious people and punishes them for it... the system is designed to do that. Here it's the opposite... people are ok with getting by.
11. Managing this country... for anyone is an insane nightmare. It's a complex problem on a scale that's simply unprecedented in human history. Indians should be extremely proud of how far they've come. Somehow India just chugs along and works... flaws and all.

**The Negatives:**

1. Indians have gotten soft. A little bit of affluence made them too soft. Kids don't slog for IIT's anymore, they prefer ""well-roundedness"" or whatever first-world thing they try to emulate. The only Indians who really grind are the really poor ones who travel as laborers hawking goods.
2. It's all style over substance. Indians gate themselves into communities and build basketball courts etc. But as a whole don't implement zoning regulations etc.
3. It's actually fallen behind in tech a bit. I've met CS grads specializing in ML from IIT Delhi who didn't know what a transformer was... imagine that
4. Just as a snake doesn't know it's a snake. Indians know nothing about India. They limit themselves to local politics and gossip but have no idea about any other location or the vast diversity of this nation.
5. Given that most advancements and developments happen in English, most middle-class Indians wouldn't be able to articulate or formulate complex thoughts and calculate 2nd order consequences. Not all languages are the same in this regard and not knowing English fluently is a huge handicap. Basically I'm saying that most Indians are not particularly bright.
6. Things like NMACC etc are built as symbols for the aspirational Indian middle class to feel a sense of global cosmopolitanism but fall far short of the Oculus in NYC or O2 in London.  India truly has nothing for it's ultra rich. It's all hype with little to show for it. Nita Ambani or some pet project of some film star to build malls isn't going to cut it. It'll require serious private equity backing on a corporate level to build an experience in India to rival global standards. Indians as such don't have anything worth seeing in its cities.
7. India over indexes on engineering talent and severely under invests in design talent. Everything is designed so poorly... showers have no glass doors or tubs so the water falls right on the toiler bowl. They also don't use toilet paper and use bidets so it makes it very weird and tracks dirt and grime. Doors use bolts which can be locked from the outside... so anyone can lock you in your own home from the outside by bolting it. Many other examples of retarded design.
8. Indian houses are nightmares with live electricity cables, shitty designs etc
9. Traffic laws are non-existent and honking is ever-present.
10. Ambition in Indians is dying. Even auto drivers I spoke to told me how happy they were with what they were doing and had no fiscal planning.
11. There are too many people and not enough jobs. So you have stupid jobs like lift operator... a guy who sits in the elevator and his job is to ask you your floor and press the button... so many other stupid jobs like this. Automation will kill the Indian workforce.
12. There extremely dehumanizing jobs involving sewage etc that are still done by untouchables and lower castes. Pray to god everyday you're born into the family you were born into.
13. Urban cities in India are very ugly.. there is nothing beautiful as such here. The cityscape and such is very ugly. There are junkyards in California with less filth than Juhu Beach... maybe the deserts of rajasthan and himalayas are beautiful but Indian cities are extremely ugly.
14. There's dust, pollution... industrial waste and contamination and mosquitoes everywhere...
15. Areas like Malabar Hill, Jubilee Hills, Poes Garden aren't even better than your average suburban neighhborhood in Palo Alto. I'm sure the inside is better and opulent but again... there are diminishing returns to that. What's the point of building Antilia if all you can see are slums? To assert power in the city?
16. A lot of these negatives are worse in areas like San Francisco but India doesn't balance it out with high pay or high innovation like SF.

india,year,When Moscow Chose China: Jaishankar Forgets Russia's 1962 Choice,"The Economic Times: [Russia has never done anything to impact our interests negatively](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/russia-has-never-done-anything-to-impact-our-interests-negatively-eam-s-jaishankar/articleshow/114427764.cms): EAM S Jaishankar (22 October 2024)

>Russia has never done anything to impact our interests negatively. -- EAM S. Jaishankar, NDTV World Summit, 21-22 October 2024

Bajpai, Kanti (2021). Perimeters: From cooperation to conflict. In *India versus China: Why they are not friends* (pp. 101–103). Juggernaut

>*The decision for war*

>From all accounts, China finally took a decision to go to war on 6 October. They attacked in strength in both the eastern and western sectors two weeks later. Four days into the war, Zhou offered Nehru a deal; in the western sector, both armies would pull back twenty kilometres from the Line of Actual Control as on 7 November 1959. China would then return to its positions north of the McMahon Line. This would be followed by a meeting of the two prime ministers. When Delhi rejected the proposal, China resumed operations on 16 November. With Indian defences crumbling, China abruptly stopped its advance on 21 November and started to pull back to positions north of the McMahon Line. The war, of eleven days of actual fighting, was over. It remains India's shortest war.

>Why in the end did China attack? The best account of Chinese decision-making is Garver's, which is based on China's official histories, informed accounts by former officials, and academic writings. In it, he argues that Mao and his senior advisers were convinced that India was destabilising Tibet and wanted to turn it into an independent buffer zone; that India in the end did not want to negotiate any or all parts of the border sincerely and was not open to a political resolution (that is, the swap); and that the Forward Policy was militarily provocative and dangerous for China. While there may have been other motives as well - and Garver suggests that Chinese discourse on the necessity of war also refers to the relations with Moscow and Washington - Tibet, the border stalemate, and the Forward Policy were central.

>At the heart of it all was not territory itself. Rather, it was the significance of the territory, particularly in the western sector, for Chinese control over Tibet. Given Beijing's assessment of Indian behaviour on Tibet, the border negotiations, and Indian military moves, it decided that Delhi needed to be administered a painful shock. A limited Chinese attack would be fruitless: defeating a weak Indian force in the west would fail to make the strategic point. Mao insisted on a large-scale attack all along the border but aimed particularly at India's military strength, which was in the eastern sector. It was also the case that in border negotiations India had been most adamant in refusing to discuss the McMahon Line. On 6 October, when China received India's rejection of Beijing's 3 October proposal for talks on the entire border, the decision for war was more or less made. The military was told, 'If Indian forces attack us, you should hit back fiercely . . . not only repel them, but hit them fiercely and make them hurt.' Marshal Liu Bocheng, who headed the Central Military Commission (CMC), insisted that Chinese forces could not use limited tactics but rather had to 'kill, wound, and capture the enemy'.

>China was helped in its war decision-making by American and Soviet diplomacy. Beijing's relations with both powers were tense, but ironically their messaging reassured China in respect of war with India. In May 1962, Zhou asked the Chinese diplomat Wang Bingnan to meet his US counterpart in Warsaw. Since 1955, in absence of formal diplomatic ties, China and the US had convened a dialogue in Poland to deal with bilateral matters (which, in a further irony, India had helped organise).

>In 1962, Wang's mission was to assess the US response to a possible Taiwanese invasion of the mainland. Beijing feared that the US might allow the Taiwanese, who were threatening to invade, to mount an attack into southern China from Laos. If so, China would have been at war in the west with India and in the south with the Taiwanese forces. In June, to Beijing's relief, the US told Wang that Washington would not support a Taiwanese attack. By July, an international peace agreement had been signed, committing the US not to deploy its troops in Laos, further suggesting that China's southern flank was secure. The US may therefore have unwittingly contributed to China's decision to go to war with India.

>**The Soviet role was less unwitting**. Moscow and Beijing had been drifting apart ideologically and strategically since the late 1950s, **but in October 1962 as the Cuban missile crisis loomed, the Soviets shifted ground in the India-China quarrel**. In 1959, Khrushchev had had some harsh words for Mao and Zhou on their handling of Tibet and India. But by October 1962, knowing that the emplacement of nuclear weapons in Cuba was likely to develop into a crisis with Washington, Moscow wanted to firm up support in the socialist world. China was vital in this regard. On 14 October, **just six days before China attacked India, Moscow conveyed to Beijing that it would 'stand together with China' in the event of an India-China war**. Garver suggests in addition that **the Soviets may even have indicated the dates of the impending missile crisis, namely, late October to mid-November when US congressional elections were due**. This time frame coincided nicely with Beijing's eventual plans to go to war with India. (emphasis mine)

With President Vladimir Putin set to visit India, we must ask: is Moscow’s loyalty a strategic convenience, or has the optimism of New Delhi blinded us to history's lessons?

india,year,Kissinger Goes to China — Turmoil under Heaven,"With Trump receiving an invitation from Xi to visit China, is the past knocking on our door? I believe it is. Consider this excerpt from Gary Bass's book on the Bangladesh Liberation War. The year is 1971.

Bass, Gary J. **The Blood Telegram: India’s Secret War in East Pakistan**. Penguin Books India, 2013, p. 175-177.

When Kissinger landed back in Islamabad, the Pakistanis maintained the deception, driving him out of town and then back into the city, as if returning from the Nathiagali hill station. Kissinger, paying a quick thank-you call on Yahya, found him ""boyishly ecstatic at having pulled off this coup"" — a somewhat unfortunate phrase for a military dictator. Harold Saunders remember his boss's excitement. ""There was a feeling of real achievement,"" he says. ""Henry was not one to show real exuberance, but he was very strongly moved."" He adds, ""You see the depths in which he thought about the relationship with Zhou, which translates back into how we conducted the relationship with Pakistan.""

At Nixon's mansion in San Clemente, California, the president waited anxiously. Nixon said that ""when Henry gets back, he'll be the mystery man of the age."" The president did not want to let in daylight upon magic: ""the key to this whole story . . . is to create doubt and mystery. Never deny the 'stomachache' thing in Pakistan. Say it was true, but then the other things also happened."" When a beaming Kissinger finally landed in San Clemente at 7 a.m. on July 13, he was greeted by the president, who took him to a celebratory breakfast. H. R. Haldeman noted, ""It's pretty clear that the Chinese want it just as badly as we do."" Kissinger's team was met by Alexander Haig, the deputy national security advisor, who, as Saunders recalls, ""came over and warned each of us individually not to tell anyone where you'd been."" He remembers, ""We didn't want it to come out until Nixon announced it. Al said, 'Now I have to go to explain to Secretary Rogers what happened.'""

Two days later, on July 15, Nixon went on national television to astound Americans by announcing that he had accepted an invitation to visit China. People around the globe were flabbergasted at Kissinger's secret mission. From the Islamabad embassy, Joseph Garland informed Kissinger, he ""had never seen so many jaws drop.""

Nixon gushingly told Yahya that he would ""always remember with deep gratitude what you have done."" Kissinger warmly wrote to Yahya, ""I have so many reasons to thank you that it is difficult to know where to begin."" As Nixon told the Pakistani ambassador, ""it all started with my good relationship with Yahya."" Years later, Nixon still deplored that the United States had not managed to be generous enough to Yahya. Haldeman wrote that he and the president ""got to talking about Yahya's cooperation in this whole thing with Henry, particularly how funny it was that Yahya made such a point at the luncheon in Islamabad of making a fuss over Henry's so-called stomachache, and in effect ordering him to the mountain retreat, saying he would send his Deputy Foreign Minister to keep him company, and so on, making a big public fuss out of Henry's indisposition so that it would be reported as such, and give Henry the cover he was seeking.

**INDIRA GANDHI'S GOVERNMENT WAS LEFT SPLUTTERING**. Indians who had imagined that their travails warranted Kissinger's attentions were humiliated to realise how little they had really mattered. As the Indian embassy in Beijing lamented, Kissinger's move was met with ""incredulity, followed by euphoria, shock or plain numbness, depending on one's political convictions."" Major General Jacob-Farj-Rafael Jacob, the chief of staff of the Indian army's Eastern Command, remembers, ""Kissinger arranged with Yahya Khan to meet the Chinese. After that, he felt obligated to Pakistan that they had done that."" Jagat Mehta, a former Indian foreign secretary, says, ""It was as much a signal to China that the U.S. can be reliable friend, but we tended to see it as if it was a threat to India.""

India's diplomats in Islamabad, who had not noticed the main event as it went on under their noses, complained ineffectually that ""Kissinger's dash to Peking"" drew ""world attention away from the Yahya regime's guilt in perpetrating one of history's biggest carnages in East Bengal."" The Nixon administration had ""incurred some kind of obligation to help the Yahya regime continue its rule over East Bengal by brute force, against all considerations of democracy and justice.""

Samuel Hoskinson, Kissinger's staffer on South Asia, had had no idea about what his boss was doing on China. This revelation, he says, explained the studied silence that his questioning of the administration's Pakistan policy had gotten from Kissinger. He suddenly realised that the ""paramount thing is this approach to China. So I'm making noise out there, not getting much response one way or the other."" Without the secret overtures to China, he says, Nixon and Kissinger might have taken a different stance on Pakistan. ""It was a China-first policy. Everything else was secondary.""

The Dacca consulate was blindsided. Archer Blood later reflected that he hoped that he would have joined with the dissent telegram even if he had known. ""You need to let your soldiers in the field have some idea of what the battle is for,"" says Scott Butcher, the junior political officer. ""They could have sent a cable to Arch Blood saying, 'We hear you, but we are not able to be as assertive as we'd like.' We still would have dissented, but the decibel level would have been down a notch or two. At least we'd know it wasn't a total blackhole of silence.""

With Nixon's own upcoming historic trip to China in the works, the president could not afford a subcontinental war in the next three or four months. ""The Indians are stirring it up,"" he told his senior foreign policy team in mid-July at a meeting at the Western White House in San Clemente. Taking the lead, he said that it was vital that Pakistan ""not be embarrassed at this point."" The Indians are ""a slippery, treacherous people."" They ""would like nothing better than to use this tragedy to destroy Pakistan."" Nixon admitted that he had ""a bias"" here — a fact lost on nobody in the room. Kissinger, the man of the hour, agreed that the Indians seemed ""bent on war. Everything they have done is an excuse for war."" He called the Indians ""insufferably arrogant.""

Kissinger, however, now seemed to realise that it was inevitable that Pakistan would break up. Standing up to Nixon and disparaging Yahya, he said that over the long run, seventy thousand West Pakistanis could not hold down East Pakistan — finally recanting his own opinion in the fatal days of March, when it had mattered most. Nixon, still sticking up for his Pakistani friend, interrupted with his high compliment that Yahya was not a politician. Kissinger, holding his ground, replied that he had urged Yahya to deliver a generous deal on the refugees, so that India would ""lose that card as an excuse for intervention."" He warned that if there was a war that dragged in China, everything they had done with China ""will go down the drain.""

On July 19, Nixon and Kissinger summoned the White House staff to the Roosevelt Room for a briefing about the president's upcoming trip to China. This momentous achievement would help to end the Vietnam War and win the Cold War itself. Nixon was somber, but Kissinger was giddy with success. ""The cloak and dagger exercise in Pakistan arranging the trip was fascinating,"" he said. ""Yahya hasn't had such fun since the last Hindu massacre!""",0,3,2025-06-05,telephonecompany,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1l45d19/kissinger_goes_to_china_turmoil_under_heaven/,kissinger

india,year,"If I had a magic wand to completely reform India, the few changes I would bring:","These are personally my views, in which if I had an opportunity to reform India, I would implement said changes. I would like to point out none of my policies align with a specific party but rather substantiate my points with data, experts analysis, and issues which are close to my heart. I would appreciate constructive criticism on any positions, give me a differing opinion or add on to the list:

1. Make the ACB (Anti Corruption Board) a completely independent body out of the arms reach of the Legislative and Executive. It would be monitored by a body of Supreme Court Judges where they have the complete liberty and freedom to conduct raids on politicians, ministers and judges. Daily quotas on raiding houses of suspects and special ACB courts to keep financial accountability of politicians. Auditing of accounts at random, special house-checks at random which is streamed live and a mandatory publicised questionnaire on assets and liabilities to enhance accountability in video-format. Including ruling party and non-ruling party members.
2. Reinstate NJAC, to ensure nepotism does not occur at the SC/HC level. CJI, LoP and PM in the 3-member appointment committee. A secretariat established at the Ministry of Law and Justice with minutes of meetings be publicly displayed.
3. Productivity-based incentives for public employees, and removal of job securities. Need to work hard to be paid equally well. This will ensure complete efficiency in all governmental sector jobs and public jobs. Promotions on basis of targets and productivity solely. Basically corporatising all govt  depts. to maximise efficency
4. Every Minister on a video-format on a daily basis should give a 10-15 minute briefing on every action which they took that day, why they took that, and what plans are they taking on issues which fall under their department. A  cabinet press-conference should be conducted on a weekly basis for a minimum of 2 hours where questions are asked to the minister on basis of the expertise of the issue, and questions taken on the PM.
5. Specialisations in bureaucracy where transfers need to be capped at a minimum of  2-per year and inter-departmental transfers do not take place. A minimum time of each member in said position should be for 2.5 years to ensure that long-term institutional memory takes place and IAS officers are specialists instead of generalists. Lateral entry should be allowed in every dept/ ministry to fill up positions and separation of IAS, IPS, IFS and other Class-A officers into different examinations. Increasing the number of officers at the grass root level to ensure that 1 IAS officer every 10,000 citizens.
6. Introduction of Non Creamy Layer in SC & ST's to ensure that educationally empowered and financially well-off families do not take away seats which are needed for socially, educationally and financially-backward houses. Removal of reservations in government professions  especially at DRDO, ISRO and other institutions of critical importance.
7. Introducing an additional district court, every district, increasing judicial capacity and creating more vacancies in judiciary positions in order to alleviate the backlog of 45 million cases. Introducing fast-track courts every district for discharging justice on severe offense (rape, murder, sexual harassment etc.,) and creation of ad-hoc courts for petty offenses over a minimum threshold level. This is to alleviate. I believe these measures will also not suffice in bringing the courts to par with the incoming cases.
8. Severe investments into public transport at every metropolitan city by ensuring every metropolitan city has metro connectivity of a minimum 350 kilometers (similar to Delhi) and a intra-city rail connectivity connecting less-dense and upcoming areas of the city. The minimum travel time once reduced to half present, investment into creating more road infrastructure should be presented.
9. Complete decentralisation in which local municipal boards and gram panchayats get a minimum of 50% of the Indian budget.  Local boards focus on cleanliness, hygiene, sanitation, health and education at every city should be provided with targets, and target-measure mechanisms adopted and actions taken be publicised on a daily level to ensure appropriate public scrutiny occurs.
10. A cap on each MP/MLA/alderman/gram panchayat to stand in elections for two terms, to ensure incumbency-fatigue  and monopolisation of power does not occur.
11. Remove all non-essential  into subsidies (ranging from ladli behen/ gruha lakshmi, free electricity crap all the way to subdisdised electricity to farmers) every dollar removed from subsidies would be reinvested in R&D and other infrastructure for technology and other science-field innovations. This will plug the cognitive drain and bolster India to be a tech-leader far after China and US. 
12. Reducing the tax burden on the middle class, and the 1% of Indians who pay tax, penetrating the taxation into the informal and unorganised sector via a series of measures (making it mandatory to except UPI payments, keeping a good check of the hoards of black money) this will increase the amount of people under the tax system, increase govts revenues (many panipuri walas/ chaiwalas are earning a good 10lpa and not paying any tax.) This revenue could be better utilised for critical sectors which require funds. (aim is to get the top 10% of Indians under taxation) 
13. Recognise top talents in every field across the world, pay exorbiant amount of salaries to them bring them to India, find top talent Indians and cater them to work together for an exchange of knowledge in fields India could pioneer and advance in. Complete govt. funding and ownership of emerging technologies (priority in critical and defense tech.)
14. Stop constructions of new govt. schools, redirect all funds into quality improvisation of existing govt. schools, bring all state-sponsored education under CBSE Board, who will appoint teachers on performance basis, incorporate Atal thinking labs and a holistic quality education based on experiential learning in every rural school.  A minimum 10% Budget directed to education (uphold the spirit of art 21A.) (aim is to blur the lines b/w a private and a govt. school)
15. Remove UGC, enhance the purview of CBSE to all educations, and a centralised education system in all universities where the courses, curriculum, experiments, internships are all detaily outlined by the Board, every semester examination/oral examination should be standardised in every field in every university across the country. Abolish Deemed University concept, all engineering, medical, paramedical, arts degree should follow one high quality education with textbooks and sources of the govt. (the aim is to blur the lines b/w a private and a govt. college) (why should IIT engineers have a superior quality of education and the remaining 98% engineers so under-qualified they don't deserve to be hired.) Syllabus should be revised every year with an updation to global standards.

india,year,"The Root of India's Problems: Education, Reservations, and a Mindset Shift","In India, many government jobs come with reservation quotas that go up to 60%. While the intention behind reservations is to address historical injustices and provide opportunities to marginalized communities, the implementation often results in deserving candidates being left out. This, in turn, allows some undeserving individuals to secure key positions, leading to inefficiency in governance and instances of corruption, like the misuse of funds or power for personal or political gain (chanda collection being one example).

However, reservations are just one part of the problem. At its core, our outdated education system is failing us. By the time most students graduate, their knowledge and skills are obsolete for the current economy. A transformative Education for All movement is urgently needed. Every child must have access to quality education, and to ensure accountability, government officials and bureaucrats should be required to enroll their children in government-run schools. This will naturally create a push for reforms and higher standards in public education.

But systemic reform alone isn't enough. A larger challenge lies in our collective mindset. As a society, we often exhibit a crab mentality—holding each other back instead of lifting each other up. Many business owners prioritize short-term profits over long-term ethical practices, creating a domino effect where entire industries are forced into illegality to stay competitive. Similarly, some employees focus on giving the least effort possible while expecting maximum pay, fostering inefficiency.

The government, as a reflection of society, inherits these dysfunctions. Corruption, inefficiency, and populism dominate policy-making. For instance, while over 70% of India's population is still considered poor or low-income, a small fraction of taxpayers (about 2-3% of the population) is expected to shoulder the burden of funding not just the nation but also corrupt officials and politically motivated freebies distributed before elections.

My two cents? The path forward requires a dual approach:

1. Systemic reforms—Starting with education, healthcare, and public accountability mechanisms. Reservations should be reviewed and refined to focus more on uplifting the economically disadvantaged rather than solely on caste or community.


2. Mindset shift—As individuals, we need to take responsibility for our actions. Ethical business practices, fair contributions as employees, and rejecting short-term populist schemes as voters can collectively create a culture of accountability and progress.



India has immense potential, but without introspection and action, we risk remaining stuck in cycles of inefficiency and inequality. Change begins with each of us.

india,year,Some Interesting snippets I read in three profound books this week.,"I am a history and defense aficionado and the whole conflict got me to think of some really interesting conjectures which intriguingly have gotten validated over the course of my reading experience. I had the pleasure of reading sporadically, ,three wonderfully insightful books namely, *""Pakistan's Foreign Policy-A Reappraisal""* by *Shahid Amin* ,  *""Magnificent Delusions""* by *""Hussein Haqqani""* , and *""The Secret Relationship:Israel and The Muslim World""* by  Yossi Melman and Dan Raviv. 

The first two essentially talk about what the Pakistani elite's conception of jihad has to do with Pakistan's future with regards to India and Israel echoing the same undertones of Venkat Dhulipala's scholarly work on the subcontinent's modern political and religious history. In a jist, I can surmised them in a coalescence to have articulated that the average Pakistani Punjabi elite thinks very much in the same way as an Israeli elite would. This is something which we all are pretty much aware about. But the most surprising work that affirmed by conjecture was the last book I mentioned and here are some chronological snippets I wish to share. 


1. David Ben-Gurion's cabinet notes which were declassified posthumously. 

In these writings, the founding father of the state of Israel noted the paralleism and similarities between the Two Nation Theory and Zionism expounding that these two ideologies shared a common logic that religion as a foundational national identity, justifying the creation of a new state. Some early Western thinkers like Lothrop Stoddard too noticed these parallels. A quote from the source ""While Pakistan officially aligned itself with the Arab-Muslim bloc and vocally opposed Zionism, Pakistani diplomats were aware of the geopolitical importance of Israel, particularly in relation to US foreign policy and Cold War alignments"" 


2. The Bhutto Era 


Before adopting a hardline stance later in his career, Bhutto reportedly met Israeli diplomats in Paris in the 1960s, according to The Jewish Chronicle and some diplomatic cables.In a conversation documented by Israeli scholars, he remarked:

""We are in similar boats, born of partition. Yet history and politics force us apart.”

These can be found in the archives of the Knesset 


3. The Zia Affair of the 1980s.

In response to a secret communique sent by Zia Ul Haq to Mossad, which requested them to provide guidance to tackle Shia Fundamentalism particularly after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, led Israel making a proposition to formally train and arm Pakistani military alongside the USA to deal with the ""dual menace"" of the Soviets in Afghanistan and the Shias in Pakistan. But, Pakistan, wary of Arab backlash because of the results of the Yom Kippur War of 1973, didn't formalize any relationship. It is even reported that after killing 20,000 Palestinians in the Black September operation in Jordan, Zia reportedly even met with the then Mossad Chief Isser Harel, a meeting brokered by King Abdullah of Jordan in Amman. The Israeli proposition, it has been noted, remains unanswered with a clear verbatim, to date. 


Moshe Sharrett, Israel's first foreign minister and Efraim Halevy too have confirmed the veracity of intelligence cooperation between the ISI and the MOSSAD.  

This is an excerpt from the latter's interview to Al Jazeera in 2006 

“Pakistan is a country we have had indirect contact with... there have been moments when intelligence interests overlapped, particularly in the context of Afghanistan and Iran.”


4.  ""Maverick"" Musharraf 

Though the subordinate military elites have had reservations with Israel for having armed india before and during the Kargil War, Pervez Musharraf publicly shook hands with Israeli officials in 2005 in Ankara and gave a speech to the American Jewish Congress in New York. 

A quote from that speech : 

""Pakistan has no direct enmity with Israel. We must review our policy in the light of changing geopolitical realities.”

He even emphasised the pragmatism of this relationship in his memoir In the Line of Fire . 




Any sane reading of historical processes can debunk the narrative that Pakistan is a weak and oppressed Gaza to rhe beligerent and aggressive Israel that India is. Pakistanis falsely equating this to the Palestinian cause unfortunately just contributes to the denigration of their struggle against occupation.

india,year,"India’s Road Safety Crisis: The Data, The Solutions, and How Can We Push for Change","Hey everyone,

I've been driving for over 11 years without a single traffic violation, but I've had my share of close calls (like yesterday in Bangalore when a parked car suddenly pulled out while I was passing it, causing a minor rear-end collision with a two-wheeler behind me).

These experiences made me curious about what works to make roads safer, so I dove into the data. What I found was shocking - it's not just about driver behavior.

The National Crisis

- India loses 168,491 lives annually to road crashes (2022 data)
- This costs our economy 3-5% of GDP (₹8-13 lakh crore annually)
- 44% of victims nationwide are two-wheeler users
- We have the highest road fatality rate among BRICS nations except South Africa
- Tamil Nadu cut fatalities by 18% and Gujarat by 8% with coordinated safety programs
- The framework for a points-based licensing system was added in the 2019 Motor Vehicles Amendment Act but remains unimplemented
- China reduced its road death rate to less than half of India's through mandatory safety equipment laws

What Actually Works (With Highest ROI)

1. 30 km/h school/residential zones + raised crossings (saves ~410 lives per ₹100 cr invested)
   - Singapore implemented this and virtually eliminated school-area deaths

2. GPS speed governors for buses & commercial vehicles (saves ~340 lives per ₹100 cr)
   - Kenya tried this and cut fatal crashes by 30%

3. Intersection improvements with adaptive traffic control + AI cameras (saves ~270 lives per ₹100 cr)
   - Bengaluru's pilot already cut violations by 23%

What's Stopping Us?

It's not knowledge - it's funding and political will. The central government allocated only ₹273 Crore (0.10% of MoRTH's budget) towards road safety, while crash costs drain 3-5% of GDP. Most states spend less than 0.2% of their transport budgets on safety measures.

What Can We Do?

I'm drafting an open letter to Nitin Gadkari with specific policy asks. Would you:
1. Share your own road safety stories from your city/state?
2. Support a call for 2% of all road construction budgets to be dedicated to safety measures?
3. Help identify the most dangerous intersections in your city for a nationwide mapping project?
4. Add your name to a petition for implementing the points-based license system nationwide?

TL;DR: 
India has the world's deadliest roads, but simple, cost-effective solutions exist and aren't being implemented. Let's push our government to act.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",2,7,2025-04-17,kkin1995,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1k1ivos/indias_road_safety_crisis_the_data_the_solutions/,indias road safety crisis the data the solutions and how can we push for change,hey everyone ive been driving for over years without a single traffic violation but ive had my share of close calls like yesterday in bangalore when a parked car suddenly pulled out while i was passing it causing a minor rearend collision with a twowheeler behind me these experiences made me curious about what works to make roads safer so i dove into the data what i found was shocking its not just about driver behavior the national crisis india loses lives annually to road crashes data this costs our economy of gdp lakh crore annually of victims nationwide are twowheeler users we have the highest road fatality rate among brics nations except south africa tamil nadu cut fatalities by and gujarat by with coordinated safety programs the framework for a pointsbased licensing system was added in the motor vehicles amendment act but remains unimplemented china reduced its road death rate to less than half of indias through mandatory safety equipment laws what actually works with highest roi kmh schoolresidential zones raised crossings saves lives per cr invested singapore implemented this and virtually eliminated schoolarea deaths gps speed governors for buses commercial vehicles saves lives per cr kenya tried this and cut fatal crashes by intersection improvements with adaptive traffic control ai cameras saves lives per cr bengalurus pilot already cut violations by whats stopping us its not knowledge its funding and political will the central government allocated only crore of morths budget towards road safety while crash costs drain of gdp most states spend less than of their transport budgets on safety measures what can we do im drafting an open letter to nitin gadkari with specific policy asks would you share your own road safety stories from your citystate support a call for of all road construction budgets to be dedicated to safety measures help identify the most dangerous intersections in your city for a nationwide mapping project add your name to a petition for implementing the pointsbased license system nationwide tldr india has the worlds deadliest roads but simple costeffective solutions exist and arent being implemented lets push our government to act,indias road safety crisis data solutions push change,hey everyone ive driving years without single traffic violation ive share close calls like yesterday bangalore parked car suddenly pulled passing causing minor rearend collision twowheeler behind experiences made curious works make roads safer dove data found shocking driver behavior national crisis india loses lives annually road crashes data costs economy gdp lakh crore annually victims nationwide twowheeler users highest road fatality rate among brics nations except south africa tamil nadu cut fatalities gujarat coordinated safety programs framework pointsbased licensing system added motor vehicles amendment act remains unimplemented china reduced road death rate less half indias mandatory safety equipment laws actually works highest roi kmh schoolresidential zones raised crossings saves lives per cr invested singapore implemented virtually eliminated schoolarea deaths gps speed governors buses commercial vehicles saves lives per cr kenya tried cut fatal crashes intersection improvements adaptive traffic control ai cameras saves lives per cr bengalurus pilot already cut violations whats stopping us knowledge funding political central government allocated crore morths budget towards road safety crash costs drain gdp states spend less transport budgets safety measures im drafting open letter nitin gadkari specific policy asks would share road safety stories citystate support call road construction budgets dedicated safety measures help identify dangerous intersections city nationwide mapping project add name petition implementing pointsbased license system nationwide tldr india worlds deadliest roads simple costeffective solutions exist arent implemented lets push government act,False,-0.37875479459762573,Neutral,Real Text
india,year,Is Tesla’s Entry in India Overhyped? The Real Impact of Lower Import Tariffs,"I see a lot of excitement about Tesla’s potential entry into India due to reduced import tariffs, along with praise for Trump’s reciprocal tariff policy. But is this really good for India’s economy and manufacturing sector?

If we lower import tariffs across the board, it won’t just bring “competition” for Indian brands—it could kill them. Why? Because companies won’t feel the need to set up manufacturing or assembly units in India anymore. Instead, they’ll just import from China, Vietnam, or other low-cost countries, undercutting local brands like Tata, Mahindra (Born Electric), and others.

The impact? Fewer factories, fewer jobs, and more reliance on foreign-made products—completely going against the Make in India and Made in India initiatives. With our population growing, do we really want to risk reducing job opportunities in manufacturing?

Also, is Tesla’s entry really that big of a deal? We already have solid EV options from Tata and Mahindra. Tesla isn’t magically solving EV infrastructure problems in India either—charging stations, grid readiness, and affordability remain key challenges.

Are we overhyping Tesla while ignoring the bigger economic consequences? Would love to hear your thoughts!

india,year,"Is establishing a National Shadow Cabinet (Led by Congress) in India appropriate when people vote based on face, caste & religion? Some states tried it quietly, but it went unnoticed due to lack of effort and recognition. Will it shift the focus from caste and religion to governance and vision?","In India, politics often feels like it’s all about party faces, religion or caste rather than what Politians actually do or plan for the future. Politians rarely talk about policies, performance, real numbers, clear visions or how well the government is actually performing. Mostly, they just end up attacking eachother or do pointless arguments or throw empty insults instead of focusing on the issues that matter. Either they talk about previous governments mistakes or play blame game. Criticism is there but nobody talk about any Idea or vision or any solution for better future. 

I have seen Shadow Ministry structure in the UK and Australia which hold the ruling government accountable and prepare the opposition as a government-in-waiting. Atleast they talk about their vision and monitor performance of ruling Government. This made me think: 

“ Isn’t it make sense for Congress, to set up a National Shadow Cabinet and actually talk about vision, plans and performance instead of just reacting to headlines? “

Take it as a platform where opposition leaders monitor, critique and provide alternative policies to the ruling government in real time. In the end, it’s all about welfare of India. 

Interestingly, we have seen some experiments at forming the State Level Shadow Cabinet  in India:

1. In 2025, NCP (SP) sets up Shadow Cabinet in order to monitoring the performance of the BJP-ShivSena government. In 2020, MNS tried to set up Shadow Cabinet as well. Back in 2005, BJP-SS formed shadow cabinet to counter Congress-NCP Government. 

2. As per some reports, BJP in J&K reported to form Shadow Cabinet to keep NC led Government in check. 

3. In 2024, Biju Janata Dal’s Naveen Patnaik announced Shadow Cabinet after losing power to BJP. He assigned various departments to 50 party MLAs. 

4. In 2018, Kerala witnessed Civil Society Shadow Cabinet led by civil society members to scrutinise policies. It Include social activists and experts. 

5. In 2015, Goa based Gen Next, a non governmental organisation analysed policies of the ruling government in Goa, despite not being an official opposition entity.

6. In 2014, Madhya Pardesh witnessed Congress led Shadow Cabinet to keep a close watch on BJP Government work.

Despite these efforts by political parties including BJP and Congress, none of these shadow governments have made a noticeable impact. Many people don’t even know they exist. There’s been no major policy alternative offered, no structured debates and no consistent visibility. They exist in name only.

After Considering all these facts, I would love to hear from people:

1. Is it appropriate for opposition led by Congress to form National Shadow Cabinet despite knowing about limited voters who are more concerned about performance and vision rather than caste or religion based politics. 

2. Can a National Shadow Cabinet shift the focus from identity, Caste and Religion based politics to policy / Performance or Vision driven debates?

I understand it’s very debatable. Still, Thank you for your time. Looking forward to your thoughts :) ",6,2,2025-05-17,Best-Biscotti9401,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1koo3lr/is_establishing_a_national_shadow_cabinet_led_by/,is establishing a national

india,year,What’s Going on With MEA’s Overseas Real Estate Deals? Who’s Watching?,"In May 2024, *The New Indian Express* dropped a bombshell story\[1\] about the Ministry of External Affairs investigating overpriced real estate deals by Indian diplomats abroad. Apparently, some embassies bought land at double or even triple the market price – all funded by taxpayer money. While the Comptroller and Auditor General raised the initial red flags, there’s been little follow-up from the government or media. This silence makes one wonder: *How much do we really care about holding our officials accountable?*

Within India, vigilant citizens and the press can somewhat keep an eye on government spending and misuse of public funds. But what about overseas, especially in countries with limited rule of law or a weak press presence, like some regions in Africa? How do we monitor what goes on in these diplomatic offices and embassies where there’s minimal local interest, if any, in exposing corruption? The Wire recently reported on Exim Bank’s funny loans\[2\] to African nations, which were hardly expected to be repaid – another example of public funds flowing into murky international ventures.

Are we footing massive GST bills and taxes just to support a system where cushy overseas postings for IFS babucrats come with opportunities for misuse of public funds? When taxpayer money is on the line, shouldn’t there be tighter scrutiny, even when it crosses borders? And if they are busy embezzling funds, who is looking out for our national and strategic interests? Are we truly destined to carry the weight of this corrupt babudom for eternity? Do our incorruptible BJP politicians also have their hands in the cookie jar? This situation demands more transparency – if the MEA is probing, shouldn’t we at least know the results?

india,year,From Equal Citizens to Parasites: An Ideological Assault on the Welfare State and the Rights of the Citizens,"*The welfare schemes for the poor are often inadequate and meant as a compromise for their worsening conditions. The Government must focus on ensuring fair wages and social security for all its citizens, not just the rich.*

Three days ago, speaking at a business summit, L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan complained that the labourers are unwilling to migrate to distant locations due to the welfare schemes and cash transfers provided by the governments. Earlier, Mr Subrahmanyan had lamented his inability to make employees work on Sundays and advocated for a 90-hour work-week.

On the same day, hearing a PIL on the issue of “freebies”, Supreme Court Justice BR Gavai claimed that the welfare schemes are creating a “class of parasites” in India. He further asserted that it is due to these schemes that labourers are not willing to work.

While the demands from the rich industrialists to deprive the poor of the welfare schemes — so they can work for lower wages or migrate — is outrageous, the same to be asserted by the highest court is even more dreadful and reveals a betrayal of the constitutional promises of equality and economic justice. It is appalling that the court considers the poor as parasites, implying that they are not the equal citizens with equal rights over the resources, but a burden on the nation whose resources belong exclusively to the rich.

At the outset, it is important to note, that the claims made by L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan and Supreme Court Justice BR Gavai, are based on anecdotes. None have cited any evidence to show that the welfare polices or cash transfers are making poor lazy or unwilling to work. In fact, many studies refute this claim.

A 2017 paper by a team of economists, including Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee, found “no systematic evidence of the cash transfer programs on either the propensity to work or the overall number of hours worked, for either men or women”. The paper noted that cash transfer programs “serve to transfer funds to low-income individuals and have been shown to reduce poverty and to improve educational outcomes and access to health services”.

It defies reason, that a monthly cash transfer of ₹2000-₹3000, which is less than half of the official poverty line, will make the poor lazy. Yet, such disingenuous arguments, offered without evidence by the capitalist establishment, and now regurgitated by the constitutional courts, are a part of the larger ideological assault against the welfare state envisioned in the Constitution of India. It attempts to facilitate the exploitation of the workers by stripping off their safety net.

Last year, a report by World Inequality Database had revealed that the economic inequality in India was higher than the colonial period, and termed it as a “Billionaire Raj”. The number of billionaires in India has doubled over the last ten years, while their wealth has more than tripled. Today, 21 super-rich individuals own more wealth than 70 crore Indians. Meanwhile, the rich also enjoy tax cuts, loan write-offs, haircut on debts, and enormous subsidies. In last five years, corporation tax cut saved ₹3 lakh crore for the richest, while banks wrote off ₹10 lakh crore of loans, many of them being wilful defaulters.

The Supreme Court, entrusted with safeguarding the rights of the people, has not for the first time shown an enthusiastic interest in safeguarding the rights of the rich. In April 2024, during a hearing in the midst of General Elections, when the demand for wealth redistribution had emerged, then CJI DY Chandrachud dismissed the socialist interpretation of the Constitution and proclaimed India as a capitalist state. In November 2024, a nine-member bench of the Supreme Court held that the material resources of the community which the state is obliged to equitably redistribute as per Article 39(b) of the Constitution, does not include private property.

The ruling party itself has repeatedly dismissed the concerns of growing economic disparity, and tried to equate the demands for economic equality as “Maoism”. During the 2024 General Elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tried to mislead the public by giving a communal narrative to wealth redistribution.

At the same time, any welfare scheme for the poor is seen with derision. The cash transfers are seen as charity, rather than the fair share of the citizens in the progress of the nation. The Prime Minister calls these policies as “revadi”, his economic advisors term it “regressive”, the courts see them as “irrational freebies”, and the financial institutions decries them as “fiscally imprudent”. It is often argued that cash transfers for the poor makes them lazy, at the same time, the huge tax cuts and subsidies for the rich is claimed to make them more productive and boost the economy.

Notwithstanding the fact that there is nothing “free” about the “freebies” — poor pay for their own welfare in the form of high indirect taxes — the welfare schemes for the poor are often inadequate and meant as a compromise for their worsening conditions.

Consider PM-KISAN, a scheme which provides a yearly financial assistance of ₹6,000 to the farmers. The scheme, launched before the 2019 General Election in an attempt to placate the farmers suffering from agricultural distress, has not been revised in six years. At the same time, despite the Government's promises of doubling the farmer's income, rural income has declined over the last five years — while agricultural income declined by 0.6% and the non-agricultural income declined by 1.4%. Despite growing demands, the Modi Government has refused to implement the legal guarantee of MSP.

Similarly, the working class is beset with stagnant wages, deteriorating employment opportunities, shrinking regular-wage jobs, and growing inflation. According to the 2025 Economic Survey of India, the wages of salaried men declined by 6.4% while the wages of salaried women declined by 12.5% over the last six years. Among the self-employed men and women, the decline was 9% and 32% respectively. At the same time, the quality of jobs has also seen a decline, with regular jobs declining by from 22.8% to 21.7%. Meanwhile, the profits of corporations reached a 15-year-high in 2023-24.

The national floor level minimum wages in India lie at a meagre ₹178 per day, practically unchanged for the last seven years. Meanwhile, the budget for rural employment guarantee scheme (MGNREGS) has been repeatedly slashed, leading to pending wages and suppression of work. Against the right of 100 days of guaranteed work, average workdays has declined to only 44 days.

The budget allocation for social security schemes, like Mid-Dal Meal, Integrated Child Development Services, National Social Assistance Programme, has declined. Due to delayed census, over 100 million people are excluded from the food security programme.

At the same time, the cost of essential commodities has sharply increased. Over the last five years, the average cost of a vegetarian meal rose by 71%. The cost of education and healthcare has similarly risen.

In this context of declining wages and increasing expenditures, the meagre cash transfers, much reviled by the capitalist class, is merely an unfair compromise between the people and the government to protect the interests of the rich. Instead of insulting the poor by calling them “lazy” and “parasites”, the Government must focus on ensuring fair wages and social security for all its citizens.

india,year,what if india is a non-damocratic country like china,"I know this question may be offensive to some people. but it is my basic crusity. As we know, India is a very big country. not only by land but population. and is very diverse. but it is also a problem when it comes to common language to interact with others. If people have more unity, then it is easy to develop fast. 

India is a democratic country. and conducts votes from time to time, but it is also a problem when it comes to development. As we know, even a government makes a good policy. It's not a guarantee that the next government will not change this policy for their own benefit. 

Even every state has its own ruling party, and sometimes it also causes slow speed of development. 

But what if India was a non-democratic country like China? I am taking China for example because China is the best example of having a developed economy even after having such a large population. I know it can cause corruption, but remember, China only has corruption at the upper level of government, not like India, where even lower-level government employees are corrupted. And in China there are strict provisions for corruption, so government employees are not that corrupted.

india,year,Supreme Court judgement : The State of Tamil Nadu vs. The Governor of Tamil Nadu - 8th April 2025,"https://www.sci.gov.in/sci-get-pdf/?diary_no=453142023&type=j&order_date=2025-04-08&from=latest_judgements_order

The interesting part of the judgement is in the conclusion. You can consider it as a TLDR summary as well. Some points that I believe are relevant are given below:

QUOTE 

436. We are in no way undermining the office of the Governor. All we say is that the Governor must act with due deference to the settled conventions of parliamentary democracy; respecting the will of the people being expressed through the legislature as-well as the elected government responsible to the people. He must perform his role of a friend, philosopher and guide with dispassion, guided not by considerations of political expediency but by the sanctity of the constitutional oath he undertakes. In times of conflict, he must be the harbinger of consensus and resolution, lubricating the functioning of the State machinery by his sagacity, wisdom and not run it into a standstill. He must be the catalyst and not an inhibitor. All his actions must be impelled keeping in mind the dignity of the high constitutional office that he occupies.

437. The Governor before he assumes office undertakes an oath to discharge his functions to the best of his ability in order to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the rule of law, along with avowing to devote himself to the service and well-being of the people of the State. Therefore, it is imperative that all his actions be guided in true allegiance to his oath and that he faithfully executes his functions that he is entrusted with by and under the Constitution. There is a reason why a specific reference is made to the well-being of the people of the State in his oath, there is a reason why he is sworn in to pledge himself to the service of the same people; the Governor as the constitutional head of the State is reposed with the responsibility to accord primacy to the will and welfare of the people of the State and earnestly work in harmony with the State machinery, as his oath not only makes this mandate anything but clear but rather also demands it of the Governor owing to the intimate and delicate nature of the functions that he performs and the potency of the ramifications that could ensue or be unleashed upon the State. Due to this, the Governor must be conscious to not create roadblocks or chokehold the State Legislature in order to thwart and trade the will of the people for political edge. The members of the State Legislature having been elected by the people of the State as an outcome of the democratic expression are better attuned to ensure the wellbeing of the people of the State. Hence, any action contrary to the express choice of the people, in other words, the State legislature would be a renege of his constitutional oath.

439. We take this opportunity to quote Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s concluding speech in the Constituent Assembly, which is as relevant today as it was in 1949 – ***“However good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot”***

441. The soul of India is its Constitution. Our Republic, the foresight of dynamic visionaries. What a great edifice, they built, ensuring sovereignty with democratic values. The Constitution is our bedrock ensuring our safety and security. It outlines a process that keeps us rooted in values. We read it for reference and for every policy decision. Without it, we would be lost and make many mistakes. It is now seventy-five years old, but we still keep turning to it, why? Because it guarantees our rights and sets benchmarks for our responsibilities. The laws and rules that uplift all people sprout from its pristine womb, welfare of all is its primary concern, but its sanctity and safety should be our prime concern.

india,year,Call to Action – Help Improve Oral Health Standards in India!,"Hello Redditors,

I’m reaching out to raise awareness about a critical public health issue that affects millions of Indians: **fluoride limits in toothpaste**. Did you know that India’s current regulation caps fluoride levels at 1000 ppm, which is insufficient to effectively prevent dental caries? This outdated limit is far below the global standards recommended by the **World Health Organization (WHO)** and **FDI World Dental Federation** (1000–1500 ppm).

# Why Does This Matter?

* **Dental Caries Epidemic**: Nearly 60% of children in India suffer from untreated cavities.
* **Ineffective Toothpaste**: Toothpaste with fluoride concentrations below 1000 ppm is not as effective in preventing cavities.
* **Economic Impact**: High-paying consumers are opting for imported brands that meet global standards, hurting domestic manufacturers.
* **Public Health Crisis**: Revising fluoride limits can significantly reduce oral health issues and healthcare costs.

# What Can You Do?

We need your support to push for policy changes that align India with global fluoride standards! Here's how you can help:

1. **Send Emails to Authorities**: I’ve compiled a list of emails for key government departments, dental associations, and media outlets. You can use the pre-drafted email template to make your voice heard.
2. **Spread Awareness**: Share this post with your friends, family, and colleagues to amplify the message. The more people involved, the stronger our impact!
3. **Engage on Social Media**: Tweet, post, or share about this issue using hashtags like #FluorideStandardsIndia #OralHealthIndia #DentalCareReform.

india,year,"BSNL Lost Rs1,757 Crore by Not Billing Reliance Jio for 10 Years: CAG","So, BSNL just forgot to bill Reliance Jio ₹1,757 crore for 10 years? And we’re supposed to believe this was just a clerical error? No, this is yet another example of how crony capitalism is thriving in India while small businesses—the real job creators—are left to rot.

The government has systematically killed BSNL, an entity that could have been a strong public sector competitor, just to ensure private telecom giants (read: Reliance) thrive. Small businesses? MSMEs? Farmers? They get scraps, endless paperwork, and harassment from tax authorities. But when it’s Reliance, suddenly, there’s a decade-long ""oversight,"" and nobody blinks?

This is the same Reliance that throws ₹1,000 crore weddings for their kids while the middle class struggles with inflation and job insecurity. The same Reliance that gets every policy tweaked in its favor while the government pretends to be pro-business.

Make no mistake—this isn’t capitalism. It’s a rigged system where taxpayer money is funneled into billionaire pockets, all while the common man is fed dreams of a ""Viksit Bharat."" This country is turning into an oligarchy, and the worst part? We’re the ones paying for it.

india,year,Hourly wages in private sector can be a huge win for working Indians,"Posting it here too since crossposting is not allowed. Want to hear your thoughts. Here's my two-cents on it:

1. I'm seeing a lot of CEOs, founders, etc. making infuriating comments on '70-hour work weeks.' This can be greatly solved if corporates are made to pay people on hourly basis. They can hire as many people as they want and even keep the office running on Sundays. People who want to work on Sundays (maybe on a slightly higher remuneration) can benefit.
2. People who would rather choose work-life balance and work for only 3 or 4 days a week can do so and take their payout as much hours they have worked. This brings me to my next point:
3. There will be more opportunities for other people to work. Unemployement rates reduces to some extent.
4. While not all jobs (CEO, managers) can be advertised at an hourly rate, most jobs can be (hospitality/IT/healthcare etc.) in my understanding since we already have an oversupply of candidates in all professions in India.
5. This will also stop companies from making people work overtime without decent compensation and against their will.

I think Indian workforce could really benefit from it. Ofc this has to be implemented by the Govt. (whether through some policies/incentives/or by force), how they do in Aus/Canada/US with a suitable minimum wage per hour.

india,year,The Shadow War Doctrine: R&AW’s 1970s Strategy in South Asia. Do you see any parallels?,"Paliwal, Avinash. “Losing the Peace: Famine, Coup, and Countercoup in Bangladesh.” *India’s Near East: A New History*, Penguin Books, 2024, pp. 212-214.

But India continued to make the same mistakes. Officials reaffirmed their faith in India’s central aims in Bangladesh after 1975: prevent anti-Indian powers from using Bangladesh as an ops base against India, and prevent Hindu exodus. But the prescription was more of the same, i.e. to have a ‘friendly government’ in Dacca and forge ‘mutually advantageous links’ as Bangladesh became ‘more and more involved with India’. It was an acknowledgement that India still viewed Bangladesh as a dependency.

Why was there a difference between theory and practice? This is where India’s hegemonic ambitions and domestic insecurities come into view. The self-critical note offered a patronising psychological analysis of Bangladesh. First, ‘intense anti-India and anti-Hindu propaganda’ before 1971 left a ‘residue’ in the subconscious Muslim minds. Second, the disconnect between East Pakistan and India meant that Bangladeshis didn’t understand India and believed all propaganda (despite the report acknowledging that Bangladeshi charges against India after 1971 were accurate). Third, being a small new nation, Bangladesh had a ‘natural sense of inferiority, which every ‘aided’ nation resents’.

The note advocated a ‘mature’ long-term approach that aimed to strengthen pro-India lobbies, and sought a ‘cultural conquest’ that would expose Bangladeshis to Indian secularism and ally with the Soviets to forestall the US-China-Pakistan nexus. Anything that undermined India’s ‘unipolarity in Bangladesh’ in the long term must be avoided. But in the near future, New Delhi had to convince Zia not to confront India. On 2 January 1976, R&AW Joint Secretary N Framji Suntook, who became chief of R&AW a year later, authored a top-secret note on the strengths and weaknesses of the Bangladeshi government and the opposition groups such as the JSD and Kader Bahini. He noted that ‘emphasis on Islamic identity by the majority community’ coupled with the rise of China and Pakistan was bad for India. Suntook listed what Pakistan’s mission would do in Bangladesh and how India must ‘counteract’.

In R&AW’s reading, Pakistan was planning to post 100–150 personnel in Dacca and open a consulate in Chittagong. Such a footprint would allow the ISI to exploit the ‘old boys network’, and have pervasive influence in Bangladeshi ministries. It risked exposing India’s problems with Bangladesh ‘from A to Z’ making Pakistan the ‘invisible third party exercising influence’ in bilateral negotiations on boundary settlement and water sharing. Pakistan could infiltrate Bangladeshi media and educational institutions to foment pro-Islamic, pro-Pakistani feelings, and encourage anti-India and anti-Hindu sentiments.

Once things started going their way, ‘Pakistan may promote the idea of a confederation’ with Bangladesh. Why? Because Bhutto viewed Bangladesh’s proximity to India’s northeast as a strategic advantage and believed this region ‘had the potential of developing into another Viet Nam’. True to style, Bhutto met with Mizo rebel leader Laldenga in 1973 to reassess Pakistan’s support after the 1971 setback. Suntook believed that Pakistan would also support Naxalites and fuel disaffection against India in Nepal. Zia’s conservative nationalism, viewed from this perspective, was anathema.

Suntook recommended an aggressive campaign. For starters, India needed to broaden and deepen its intelligence gathering system to track Pakistani operations. Such measures included cross-governmental coordination with the State Trading Corporation, Aid, Shipping, Coal Board, and so on who dealt with Bangladesh. Suntook proposed maintaining ‘steady pressure’ on Dacca about Pakistani activities, and to ‘make it clear to the leaders of Bengla Desh that their alignment with Pakistan would pose a threat to our security and would not be acceptable beyond a point’. Close cultural ties that ‘keep the memories of the freedom struggle’ and the ‘atrocities committed by Pakistan alive’ were also recommended. For this, the scale of India’s cultural activities needed to be on a scale ‘comparable to that of the Americans and the Russians in India’.

But there was a sharper edge to R&AW’s strategy. After mapping out the who’s who that could target Zia’, Suntook recommended all ‘feasible measures’ to ‘soften up areas which are contiguous to Indian territories’. In security parlance, this meant arming the Shanti and Kader Bahinis, and AL rebels such as Suttar (known to R&AW as ‘Chittu babu’).

Then came Suntook’s final blow:

>…serious thought should be given to the idea of providing strong support to anti-Pakistani activities in NWFP, and Baluchistan now being carried on from bases in Afghanistan. To relieve Pakistani pressure on India through Bengla Desh, it may be necessary to intensify pressure on Pakistan through Afghanistan to the extent that it is feasible to do so.

Suntook’s recommendations echoed bureaucratic consensus and became policy until Gandhi lost power in March 1977. Zia came to believe that R&AW was after his life. After coming to power, he prevented an Indian intervention by not declaring Bangladesh an Islamic republic. But he faced intense pressure by anti-regime elements, all of whom received covert Indian support. Officially, India communicated to the US that it was ‘calm and cool’ about Bangladesh and acknowledged that large-scale persecution of Hindus was not happening. Unofficially, it pressured Zia.

US intelligence noted that the BSF opened more training camps after November 1975 for anti-Zia rebels. By August 1976, India helped an estimated ‘two to three thousand’ such elements to cross over into Bangladesh. Cross-border violence by India-trained rebels became routine in 1976. Such kinetic support to the Shanti Bahni was accompanied by relocation of Chakma refugees to Arunachal Pradesh. To augment infiltration, the BSF launched a big operation on 20 April 1976 at the Bandarkata border post in Mymensingh. Sylhet and the Meghalaya-Tangail/Mymensigh border areas were specific points where India increased pressure. Many of these India-trained ‘miscreants’ created ‘instability’ with the ‘ultimate objective of overthrowing the existing government’.

Certain members of the Gono Bahini, the JSD’s armed wing, joined the Kader Bahini. By May 1976, India had trained the first batch of Shanti Bahini fighters in Dehradun and Haflong, Assam. By 1979, 700 Chakma fighters received training and most of the 150,000 displaced Chakmas were relocated. Just before Gandhi lost power, R&AW asked the Shanti Bahini for a ‘big push forward’ with the promise of expanding its cadre to 15,000. For his part, Suttar intensified the Bangabhumi movement for a separate Hindu state in Bangladesh. Little understood, the Bangabhumi movement resonated with Bangladeshi Hindus. ‘Our relationship with Suttar was very benign’ and the operational understanding ‘deep’ says an Indian intelligence officer with knowledge of these matters.

india,year,Lost in the Archives: Did the MEA Bungle India’s Diplomatic Timeline with Cambodia?,"India’s diplomatic relations with Cambodia present a curious case of conflicting historical claims and apparent bureaucratic oversight—or worse, apathy—on the part of New Delhi. Official accounts from the Indian [Ministry of External Affairs](https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/36629/visit+of+his+majesty+norodom+sihamoni+the+king+of+cambodia) (MEA) and the [Indian Embassy in Phnom Penh](https://embindpp.gov.in/gallery?id=e36rd) continue to place the start of these ties in 1952, even though Cambodia was still under French colonial control until November 9, 1953, and even though the late respected scholar Dr. D.R. SarDesai in his seminal work on Indo-Indochinese relations firmly dates the formal recognition to December 31, 1954, one day after the purported abrogation of the Pau Agreements (1950).

**The Discrepancy and Its Roots**

SarDesai’s research in, *Indian Foreign Policy in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, 1947–1964*, indicates that India did not extend formal diplomatic recognition to Cambodia until **31 December 1954**, one day after the “Pau Agreements” were purportedly abrogated. It is likely in the context of that day that Jawaharlal Nehru—publicly committed to the process of decolonization—would not have recognized Cambodia prior to that date since the country was still legally tied to France. Yet, official MEA statements and even celebratory events, such as the June 21, 2022 event in Phnom Penh marking the so-called 70th anniversary from 1952, fail to explain why India would have recognized Cambodia before it was independent.

The mismatch raises uncomfortable questions:

* Did anyone in the MEA verify these dates, or are such pronouncements made without consulting the national archives?
* If the archives were indeed consulted, why is the well-documented 1954 recognition date, attested by SarDesai and corroborated by Cambodia’s political trajectory, ignored? Why wasn't there any additional context provided?

[Jawaharlal Nehru meets Norodom Sihanouk, the former king of Cambodia at the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh in October 1954 \(CIA.gov\)](https://preview.redd.it/1tn6vocj9c9e1.jpg?width=813&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13cdb583a17e3e173c0f3f3b63f642d107555fdb)

**The Realpolitik Angle: French India and Nehru’s Balancing Act**

A plausible explanation emerges when one looks at the broader colonial context. At the time, France still held five enclaves in India (Pondicherry, Chandernagore, Karikal, Mahé, and Yanam), with negotiations for their handover dragging on from 1947 until November 1, 1954. France feared that relinquishing its Indian possessions too early would embolden decolonization movements in its more valuable colonies in Indochina.

* **Procrastination**: France systematically delayed transferring the enclaves from 1947 until *after* the July 21, 1954 Geneva Agreements on Indochina. This delay was largely driven by strategic considerations, as the French enclaves in India served as leverage and logistical staging grounds to maintain their colonial influence over the more valuable territories in Indochina.
* **Shift in French Position**: The French defeat in Indochina made them more amenable to abandoning their enclaves in India, culminating in an agreement in September 1954 to consult with elected representatives of French India on the question of transfer of territory.
* **Transfer of Power**: On October 18, 1954, French India’s elected representatives approved merger with India. The formal handover took place on November 1, 1954, effectively the same day Nehru returned from Cambodia.

By not recognizing Cambodia prematurely, Nehru was likely engaging in a careful balancing act: publicly championing anti-colonialism while quietly avoiding a diplomatic standoff with France, which still held territory in India. Recognizing Cambodia while French forces remained entrenched both in Indochina and on Indian soil would have jeopardized delicate negotiations over Pondicherry and the other French enclaves.

**The Pau Agreements: Abrogation or Irrelevance?**

SarDesai maintains that India recognized Cambodia immediately after the abrogation of the Pau Agreements, i.e., on December 31, 1954. Yet other sources do not explicitly reference any “formal” abrogation date. The Pau Agreements might simply have become irrelevant after the July 21, 1954 Geneva Agreements on Indochina. It is possible that the French themselves considered the agreements abrogated by December, whereas available academic archives that I have looked into are silent on a specific date.

Regardless, SarDesai’s account—backed by the logic of post-Geneva decolonization—makes it unlikely that India would have extended diplomatic recognition in 1952, when Cambodia was still a French protectorate.

**The MEA’s Present-Day Oversight**

Despite this evidence, the MEA and the Indian Embassy continue to cite 1952 as the official start of Indo-Cambodian ties. At a grand ceremony in June 2022, [dignitaries unveiled a commemorative logo and repeated the 1952 narrative](https://www.mfaic.gov.kh/Posts/2022-06-22-News-The-70th-Anniversary-of-Establishment-of-Diplomatic-Relations-between-Cambodia-and-India---21-June-2-09-33-40). The former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs Rajkumar Ranjan Singh, was also present. No context was provided regarding French colonial presence in Cambodia or India’s own vulnerability to French pressure at the time. Nor is there an official explanation for why Nehru or any other senior official only visited Cambodia in late 1954—if, in fact, diplomatic ties had existed since 1952.

One cannot help but wonder whether these essential archival records are languishing in government vaults—unexamined, neglected, or possibly lost—or if they were never maintained at the MEA at all and removed by former officials?  Equally plausible is the possibility that the MEA, whether out of sheer convenience or the sluggish grind of bureaucracy, simply couldn’t be bothered to correct this laughably wrong date, betraying the disdain they truly harbor for this diplomatic tie.

**A Quick Refresher**: In 1970, a coup d’état in Cambodia ousted Prince Norodom Sihanouk, replacing him with a pro-American regime led by General Lon Nol and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak. From 1975 to 1979, Cambodia endured the genocidal reign of the Khmer Rouge, a Maoist regime backed by China, during which approximately 2 million people perished. In 1979, Vietnamese forces overthrew the Khmer Rouge, establishing a new regime. By 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Paris Peace Agreements were signed, with India playing a significant role in peacekeeping efforts. A new constitution was adopted in 1993, paving the way for a civil government and Cambodia’s gradual recovery.

Needless to say, Cambodia lost much of its historical state records during these years of turmoil, further complicating its efforts to rebuild and reclaim its past.

**Recent Ambassadorial Notes and Unfinished Business**

Even recent developments hint at a lack of consistent engagement. Outgoing Ambassador Devyani Khobragade, in her farewell meeting with Cambodia’s Senate President Hun Sen, described her four-year stint as “[successful](https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501614566/senate-president-urges-india-to-expand-its-economic-trade-and-investment-ties/),” citing improved connectivity (direct flights between Phnom Penh and New Delhi) and cooperation on various fronts. Yet, observers of the diplomatic ties might remain unconvinced, pointing to unresolved issues like [large-scale human trafficking and cyber scams](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1g0v2zs/billion_dollar_scam_part_ii_the_arrest_of/) that proliferated during her tenure.

Her successor, Joint Secretary [Bawitlung Vanlalvawna](https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/38346/Shri+B+Vanlalvawna+appointed+as+the+next+Ambassador+of+India+to+the+Kingdom+of+Cambodia), now inherits a relationship that—on paper—spans 70-plus years yet is riddled with inaccuracies about its official inception date. At a deeper level, however, many Cambodian officials still recall that India was one of the very few non-communist states to recognize the Heng Samrin regime in the 1980s, demonstrating New Delhi’s capacity for both principled and pragmatic engagement.

**Reclaiming Historical Accuracy**

For all practical purposes, the 70th anniversary of India’s diplomatic relations with Cambodia should occur on December 31, 2024, not 2022. If the MEA seeks to demonstrate genuine respect for Cambodia and its Southeast Asian partners—particularly those with which it shares civilizational ties—it should address these discrepancies head-on.

India’s cautious stance in the early 1950s was a calculated decision made under Nehru’s watch, reflecting the realpolitik of French colonial enclaves in India and the complexities of Indochina’s decolonization. Today, however, continuing to cite 1952 without context suggests not so much a grand design as bureaucratic neglect—an irony that does no favors to India’s stated objective of deepening ties with Cambodia and the broader region.

**A Call for Historical Clarity**

In the end, a definitive understanding of when India truly extended diplomatic recognition to Cambodia ought to be more than a bureaucratic footnote. It is a reminder that India’s relationship with Southeast Asia—especially with nations sharing ancient civilizational ties—deserves better than cursory references to dubious “1952” origins. A thorough re-examination of archival material, combined with an honest acknowledgment of the reasons that shaped Nehru’s decisions, is long overdue.

SarDesai, D. R. (1968). *Indian foreign policy in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, 1947–1964*. University of California Press, pp. 64–65.

>On the diplomatic plane, the Indian efforts were, however, hampered in the beginning by a lack of any diplomatic representation in Phnom Penh or Vientiane. At the time of the Geneva Conference, none of the Associated States of Indochina had been recognized by India, although the existing consular representation in Saigon and Hanoi was continued. With the Geneva settlement granting independence to Cambodia, the latter had expected immediate recogition from India, which would help Cambodia secure recognition from other Asian and African countries. Such expectation was belied, and the Cambodian delegation to the preliminary conference of the ICC in New Delhi in August, 1954, openly expressed its resentment in the matter. The delegation regretted that India had forgotten that Cambodia ""belonged to the great Indian civilization."" The delay in Indian recognition was caused by some legal quibbling in the External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi, where the view prevailed that until the quadripartite Pau Agreements of 1950, limiting the economic and financial independence of the Indochinese states, were abrogated, the Indochinese states could not be deemed to have attained complete independence. When Nehru stopped in Phnom Penh on his return journey from China in November, 1954, the Cambodian premier drew the visitor's attention to the absence of diplomatic ties with India. There were profuse references to ancient cultural contacts between India and Cambodia in all the speeches from both sides during the visit. Nehru himself seemed to have been moved considerably by the visual impression of India's cultural impact on the country. Cambodian hospitality, the countryside, and the magnificent monuments at Angkor struck responsive chords in Nehru, who told the Indian troops serving the ICC that ""every blade of grass on either side of the road breathed Indian culture."" **One of the direct results of this visit and the cultural reminders on the occasion was the sudden Indian decision to single out Cambodia from among the Indochinese states for some kind of recognition. Accordingly, B. K. Acharya was sent to Cambodia to head a special mission with the personal rank of minister. Formal recognition of Cambodia and Laos followed on December 31, 1954, a day after the Pau Agreements were abrogated.** \[...\] (emphasis mine)

india,year,"DPIs in the shadows: MeitY and Education Ministry simply refuse to open up about the APAAR student ID
","[IFF needs your support, now more than ever. Details at the end of this post.](https://preview.redd.it/w8drhfgyxowd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0294daebb88d9a7b78e94f3db955a6a53d17a6ec)

APAAR, an Aadhaar-based unique ID project for students across India, was initiated in July 2023 and declared a ‘digital public infrastructure’ earlier this year. When asked for its policy documents, nodal Ministries transferred our RTI request 30+ times. We still don't have an answer.

# tl;dr

The Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (“**APAAR**”) framework is an Aadhaar-based unique ID project for students across India initiated in July 2023 and declared a ‘digital public infrastructure’ earlier this year. States and UTs across India have passed directions to start enrolling students to the programme based on their Aadhaar cards and hold special parent-teacher meetings to seek parental consent from parents for the same. As the project evolves, it seems to be voluntary on paper but mandatory in practice. This may be easily clarified from the law/policy document operationalising the project—but there is none. When asked for its policy documents, nodal Ministries stonewalled information, stated that they were ‘working on it’, played the blame game with other departments, and transferred our RTI request internally 30+ times (and counting). We still do not have an answer. This post unpacks what this means for student privacy and autonomy.

# Background

Back in July 2023, the Ministry of Education (“**MoE**”) in conjunction with the Ministry of Electronics and IT (“**MeitY**”) introduced a ‘one student, one unique ID’ scheme comprising the APAAR framework through a [panel discussion](https://www.education.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/nep/ABSS_Report_Session_3.pdf?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) on the implementation of the 2020 National Education Policy (“**NEP 2020**”) with an objective to issue unique IDs to students based on their Aadhaar number and store life-long longitudinal records of their educational scores, achievements, and related statistics, against it.

The enrollment process began in October 2023, when MoE [wrote](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/schools-asked-to-take-parents-consent-for-students-new-apaar-card-8983447/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in#lnsnedj5jhr6pvo1qf) to state chief secretaries asking schools to persuade students into creating APAAR IDs, which will be based on and authenticated through their Aadhaars. We could not find a copy of this missive through public portals, but some schools have uploaded it to their websites and we have [archived it here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FjzfW8kzGpSficDtdlIdWNil0FckpAQg/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in). In line with globally recognised legal principles, schools require parental consent to enrol students into the registry as the students are minors, i.e. under the age of 18. Thus the MoE Secretary, through the letter, also persuaded schools to hold a “special” parents’-teachers’ meetings “to get the consent of parents” to enrol their children into the APAAR framework. 

Through all of this, and while APAAR enrollment was underway at breakneck speed across Indian schools, we noticed a glaring lack of guiding documents in the public domain and found that any and all directions issued under the project were uploaded by schools/parents, and not by the nodal Ministries. Thus we filed a host of Right to Information (RTI) requests with both authorities, which is traced in detail in a [previous post](https://internetfreedom.in/student-id-zero-law-or-policy/). To summarise:

1. We filed our [first RTI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19tbEXAh9oSX4fI7d3Th3nwhcFna9l-oh/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) on October 19, 2023 seeking a copy of the letter from the Department of School Education and Literacy, MoE (“**DOSEL**”) to all state chief secretaries and education commissioners for the creation of APAAR IDs, and received no response. 
2. We filed our [second](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nyxt_hVWXs1upTGpQ30OyxiO-diVhtUN/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) and [third](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jkO3TYy_KGQz_0mOUfc3yYqx81ST2MW4/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) RTIs later in October with MoE asking about the status of the scheme, its backing law and/or policy documents, and other details of enrollment. We, again, received no response.
3. We filed a [fourth RTI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1605DNI2QnAYfJk2LsoLZ8dchglbKgpzq/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) with the DOSEL on November 2, 2023 asking the same questions again, and stressing on the law/policy document the authorities are using to implement the APAAR ID and framework. This time, we [received a response](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N-BDoewn5VsYCtY2d8y1OXSLYnr1skSu/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) on December 1, 2023, noting: “*for implementation of APAAR, detailed plan covering all aspects such as framing up of policies, guidelines, criteria for empanelment of schools etc are under development stage*.” Note that by this stage, about [2.2 Crore students](https://www.freepressjournal.in/education/government-to-expand-one-nation-one-student-id-initiative-to-schools?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) had been enrolled for the APAAR ID without a law/policy in place. 
4. Then we filed a [fifth RTI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qG_SNvXQxSKCljfNRf2org1_7xrtPY0_/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) asking for the earlier order sent to chief secretaries, and finally received a [copy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W-TgiJTxY0abC5Ii6nRx4KnvfO7oX6-u/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in).
5. Not giving up yet, we filed a [sixth RTI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d-4AUtztOW71QKLzje4XmTXYcoGZl4je/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) on December 28, 2023 with MoE, asking once again about the grounding law/policy for this initiative, only to receive the same response again: “*for implementation of APAAR, detailed plan covering all aspects such as framing up of policies, guidelines, criteria for empanelment of schools etc are under development stage*.” 
6. So we waited, and on February 16, 2024, made another [attempt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uq2Ae0sHBL7lS9vPbinhvoA3ULhlo1Fu/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to get these questions answered, and received an interesting [response](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11_0Qf-WzJUVsSnWyEhXTH7wM4Q2Mjlkx/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in). The RTI, which was transferred by the Education Department to Digital India Corporation, MeitY, read:

“*\[t\]he Ministry of Education (MoE) will inform about the Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) and policy for creating/ verifying the APAAR IDs. However, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), the implementing body, has developed the portal and follows the Data Privacy and Protection Act (DPDA). It is important to note that since students/ learners are minors (below 18 years of age), parental/ guardian consent is necessary for the authentication/ creation of the APAAR ID*.”

The RTI first revealed that MeitY was in fact a collaborator on the APAAR project (and had a mystery legislation ‘Data Privacy and Protection Act’?). It also signalled that 1) APAAR ID is being aggressively implemented without any law or policy written down to back it, which as we argued in our [previous post](https://internetfreedom.in/aadhaar-based-student-id-raises-alarms-for-privacy/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) makes the framework unconstitutional, and 2) the Ministries are simply shedding all accountability when it comes to questions about privacy and legality, and are claiming to use legislations that have not even been enacted yet. 

1. In April 2024, [filed another RTI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fR-zuvIjhh8aRdaFkUKgm_lyyBEyOUsd/view?usp=drive_link&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) with MeitY this time, asking what law/policy document they are following in implementing the scheme, since MoE seems to have shrugged off the responsibility of answering that question. 
2. In April 2024, we also [requested](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QGwHZbxb9A7tO_-s2i6zwOC7cNPgfzua/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) one specific document from MoE about APAAR ID which (as gathered from a [03:38:18 hour long video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqFRd9V8cag&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) of the Minister of Education and school principals talking praise about the project) was likely to contain the policy implementation plan for APAAR ID.

# Running in circles

Our April 2024 RTI request, where we [requested](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QGwHZbxb9A7tO_-s2i6zwOC7cNPgfzua/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) a specific policy document from MoE, contained two questions:

1. Please provide a copy of the document titled – Schooling: Access and Quality – presented by MoE at the 3rd National Conference of Chief Secretaries held in New Delhi on December 28-29, 2023; and
2. Please provide a copy of any responses, communication, discussions, debates or outcome documents from this meeting relating to National Education Policy 2020 and APAAR ID.

Between April and present day, i.e. late October 2024, this simple RTI request has been **transferred more than 30 times** in a cyclic manner between four departments in MeitY and MoE: Department of School Education & Literacy (“**DOSEL**”); Department of Higher Education (“**DOHED**”); Department of IT & Electronics (“**DITEC**”); and Digital India Corporation (or “**MELAB**”). And funnily enough, almost always in that order! With every department ascribing it a new RTI number, the transfer history looks like this:

1. DOSEL/R/E/24/01795
2. DOHED/R/T/24/00425 
3. DITEC/R/T/24/00267

30. DOSEL/R/T/24/00749
31. DOHED/R/T/24/00906
32. DOHED/R/T/24/00906/1

On August 12, 2024 we received a [partial response ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LK20-nty6BpY3xDh6AA_l5MJJYjr-qQH/view?usp=sharing)to the second question of our RTI where we had asked for discussions, communications or outcome documents from the meeting which was held to discuss NEP 2020. In the reply, they mentioned that the copy of the NEP 2020 and all details pertaining to this policy is available on this [website](https://www.education.gov.in/nep/about-nep). This website only comprised the policy itself and did not indicate any discussions or communications which were involved in the policy formulation. 

It is now late October and we are still waiting for the  specific document that we had asked for which had been reportedly presented in December 2023. This follows a consistent trend of evading any question regarding APAAR ID, made all the more dangerous given the speed at which enrollment is being conducted under the ID.

# All states aboard the APAAR bandwagon



Following the July 2023 circular, many states kick-started APAAR ID enrollment for schools within their territory under their NEP 2020 compliance processes, and others have now started to join in. 



Rajasthan and Chandigarh are [reported](https://www.medianama.com/2024/10/223-national-edu-policy-linked-apaar-id-to-be-rolled-out-in-chandigarh-and-rajasthan/) to start enrollment in October 2024. Odisha [planned](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/govt-to-meet-students-parents-before-apaar-id-rollout/articleshow/113681233.cms) to roll out APAAR registration starting October 15, 2024. On October 01, 2024 as [reported](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/all-school-managements-in-ap-told-to-create-apaar-ids-for-students-of-classes-9-and-10/article68704861.ece) in The Hindu, Andhra Pradesh has also directed school management/boards to create APAAR IDs for students. 



As of September 2024, Gujarat has [started](https://www.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/apaar-id-will-be-created-for-digital-records-of-28-lakh-students-from-class-9-to-12) enrollment and aims to onboard 28 lakh students, Assam has [introduced](https://dainikasam.assamtribune.com/assam/one-nation-one-student-id-apaar-id-registration-begins-for-students-in-assam-1552262?infinitescroll=1) the project, Chhattisgarh [directed](https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/chhattisgarh-govt-directs-all-district-collectors-to-facilitate-the-implementation-of-apaar-id-scheme/cid/2050927) all district collectors to facilitate the implementation of the APAAR ID scheme. 



In states like [Jharkhand](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/state-rolls-out-one-nation-one-student-id-for-edu-mgmt/articleshow/104569234.cms), and [Maharashtra](https://thewire.in/education/maharashtra-directs-schools-to-get-parental-consent-for-student-unique-ids/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), education departments had already implemented the APAAR ID in October 2023 and facilitated special parent-teacher meetings to secure parental consent for the creation of APAAR IDs. However, the departments have not issued any statements regarding whether the creation of APAAR IDs is mandatory. 



Aside from these news reports, schools, colleges and universities in some states have started the creation of APAAR IDs even without the official implementation of the scheme by the state governments. 



# Why worry?

As per interpretation of the right to privacy under *J (Retd) K.S Puttaswamy v. Union of India \[(2019) 1 SCC 1\]*, any privacy-infringing measure by the State must satisfy a five prong test for it to be a justified and reasonable restriction on the right. The first prong is legality, i.e., the privacy-infringing measure must be based in law. 



The implementation of the APAAR ID continues at worrying speeds without a clear law/policy or guiding document grounding it. All our transparency efforts in asking for the law/policy framework has resulted in the Ministries either stating it is being drafted, or sending our RTI requests on an indefinite expedition around departments with 30+ transfers. Even if the policy has since been drafted but not made public, various schools had started enrollment back in October 2023, in the absence thereof.



A highly privacy-intrusive scheme is being implemented aggressively across states without not only a specific law/policy guiding it, but also without an active data protection law. As a scheme that is linked with Aadhaar but ‘voluntary’ on paper, it also seems to be following in the footsteps of Aadhaar, in actually being ‘mandatory’ in practice. [Educationists believe](https://www.freepressjournal.in/education/apaar-id-unique-student-identification-raises-concerns-about-data-safety?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) that, much like Aadhaar verification, schools will be forced to ensure the participation of all students and parents. Though the consent of parents is mandatory, parents seem to either not know they have an option, or are not given an opportunity to say “no”. [Some parents have pointed out](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/parents-concerned-as-apaar-id-consent-form-requires-students-personal-information-101697656934269.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) that there is no option to deny consent on the Aadhaar consent form handed to them as part of the APAAR enrollment. 



Schools are also reported to be [grappling with the uncertainty](https://podcasts.apple.com/in/podcast/telanganas-detention-law-death-penalty-for-8-indians/id1406730235?i=1000633026395) of how to proceed if a parent refuses to complete the form. The MoE Secretary had instructed schools to hold “special” parent-teachers’ meetings to educate parents on the benefits of APAAR initiative and encourage them to give consent towards creating students’ APAAR IDs. This “encouragement” can easily take the form of arm-twisting, coercion, or taking consent without providing enough information. As schools are pressured into meeting certain implementation targets for the APAAR framework, they may also increasingly resort to coercion or force to get parents to give their consent. This process is more problematic in rural areas as the parents may not completely understand the consequences of giving consent due to low data or tech literacy, and may end up easily giving consent because they were told to do so by teachers. 



Instances of millions of rural, nomadic, destitute, or marginalised individuals being denied basic necessities, such as food rations, and students being [refused school admissions](https://www.deccanherald.com/india/children-without-aadhaar-shut-out-of-school-1131133.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) for not possessing an Aadhaar card are well-documented.  The fear around implementing APAAR ID as a basis for education in India is rooted in these past experiences. 



We explored these concerns in depth in our previous post, which also shed light on the fact that this is being pushed from the top. The Bharatiya Janata Party, in its 2024 Lok Sabha Elections Manifesto, pushed for the universal adoption of the problematic APAAR framework. “*We will achieve 100% implementation of ‘One Nation, One Student ID’ through the Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (APAAR) to store academic qualifications, credit scores and certificates, among others for students from pre-primary to higher education*”, the Manifesto stated.



With the party in power for another term, we may continue to move towards this 100% implementation goal without the requisite checks in place. This can be catastrophic for the privacy and autonomy of students across India, unless we resist it as a community. We believe that the way that this framework is created is invasive by design and should be rolled back.

union of india scc any privacyinfringing measure by the state must satisfy a five prong test for it to be a justified and reasonable restriction on the right the first prong is legality ie the privacyinfringing measure must be based in law the implementation of the apaar id continues at worrying speeds without a clear lawpolicy or guiding document grounding it all our transparency efforts in asking for the lawpolicy framework has resulted in the ministries either stating it is being drafted or sending our rti requests on an indefinite expedition around departments with transfers even if the policy has since been drafted but not made public various schools had started enrollment back in october in the absence thereof a highly privacyintrusive scheme is being implemented aggressively across states without not only a specific lawpolicy guiding it but also without an active data protection law as a scheme that is linked with aadhaar but voluntary on paper it also seems to be following in the footsteps of aadhaar in actually being mandatory in practice educationists believe that much like aadhaar verification schools will be forced to ensure the participation of all students and parents though the consent of parents is mandatory parents seem to either not know they have an option or are not given an opportunity to say no some parents have pointed out that there is no option to deny consent on the aadhaar consent form handed to them as part of the apaar enrollment schools are also reported to be grappling with the uncertainty of how to proceed if a parent refuses to complete the form the moe secretary had instructed schools to hold special parentteachers meetings to educate parents on the benefits of apaar initiative and encourage them to give consent towards creating students apaar ids this encouragement can easily take the form of armtwisting coercion or taking consent without providing enough information as schools are pressured into meeting certain implementation targets for the apaar framework they may also increasingly resort to coercion or force to get parents to give their consent this process is more problematic in rural areas as the parents may not completely understand the consequences of giving consent due to low data or tech literacy and may end up easily giving consent because they were told to do so by teachers instances of millions of rural nomadic destitute or marginalised individuals being denied basic necessities such as food rations and students being refused school admissions for not possessing an aadhaar card are welldocumented the fear around implementing apaar id as a basis for education in india is rooted in these past experiences we explored these concerns in depth in our previous post which also shed light on the fact that this is being pushed from the top the bharatiya janata party in its lok sabha elections manifesto pushed for the universal adoption of the problematic apaar framework we will achieve implementation of one nation one student id through the automated permanent academic account registry apaar to store academic qualifications credit scores and certificates among others for students from preprimary to higher education the manifesto stated with the party in power for another term we may continue to move towards this implementation goal without the requisite checks in place this can be catastrophic for the privacy and autonomy of students across india unless we resist it as a community we believe that the way that this framework is created is invasive by design and

india,year,How a common man can make a difference in combating heinous crimes against women,"Firstly, this is not a gender war post but I'm absolutely disgusted by the way some men on social media are reacting to the horrific Kolkata case. The fact that anyone could justify rape or reduce it to shallow comments about a woman's appearance is beyond appalling.

This kind of talk not only dehumanizes victims but also perpetuates a culture where sexual violence is downplayed and even normalized.

I completely understand why some women express feelings of anger towards men or contemplate leaving the country. The relentless fear, constant harassment, and lack of accountability can be deeply exhausting and disheartening. Having witnessed harassment affecting my friends and family, I recognize the frustration and sense of helplessness that can drive such sentiments.

""Not All Men"" has been our response. To be honest, when I read a woman write that ""Men are like this.., Men are responsible for.."" a part of me is also like - but I am not like that, most men that I know are not like that, why club us with the monsters?\\

But do we have a way of telling women who is who?  
Can we confidently tell our sisters/wives/daughters/friends that just stay away from ""this particular"" type of people, and they will be safe? The answer is No.

And that's why, as much as it hurts us, ""Not All Men"" cannot be our defence. While it’s true that not every man is a perpetrator, this response shifts the focus away from the real issue which is systemic violence against women.

If a lady doctor is no longer safe even on her campus, we are not left with any rational responses now. Just shame and anger.

After reading through countless posts and discussions on social media, I’ve compiled some insights that I believe could serve as practical solutions. Please suggest more ideas in the comments.

* Ask ourselves and encourage others to examine any behaviors, jokes, or comments that might contribute to a culture where such violence is normalized.
* Commit to stepping in when we witness harassment or assault, whether in public spaces, workplaces, even within our social circles.
* Promote discussions about consent, respect, and gender equality. Support policies that strengthen women’s safety and hold perpetrators accountable.
* Learn about women's rights, gender equality, and the impacts of assault crimes. Understanding these issues will help you advocate effectively.
* Speak out against sexist jokes, comments, and behaviors. Promoting respect and equality in your interactions sets a positive example.
* If you encounter someone who has been affected by assault, offer compassionate support. Encourage them to seek help and report the incident.
* Advocate for or help spread the use of safety apps that allow women to alert friends or authorities in case of an emergency.
* Use social media platforms to share information and raise awareness about women's safety issues.
* Demonstrate respectful behavior in all interactions. Your actions can influence others around you.
* Be open to listening to women’s experiences and perspectives. Understanding their realities can help you act more effectively.
* Read a few books, listen to some podcasts. They give historical context and personal stories that deepen your understanding of the issues. Stories from survivors and activists can foster empathy and help us connect emotionally with the realities faced by others.
* Push for improved lighting, safer public transportation, and other infrastructure changes that enhance women’s safety.
* Participate in or support local awareness campaigns and events that address women's safety and rights.
* Get involved with organizations that focus on women’s safety, empowerment, and support services. Your time and effort can make a difference.
* Promote educational programs in schools and communities that focus on consent, respect, and gender equality.
* Volunteer or donate to organizations that provide support and resources for survivors of assault.

I came across a great post by u/Great_Ad_5561 that discusses additional solutions and strategies. I encourage you to give it a read. You can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1esveei/its_about_time_we_completely_acknowledge_that/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

How have we allowed our spaces to become so unsafe, even in the very places meant for care and healing? It's time for us to demand more from our institutions, our communities, and ourselves. We must push for stricter security measures, better laws, and, most importantly, a shift in societal attitudes towards women and safety.

Don’t just tell women that you feel so bad and you can’t believe men like this exist and then do nothing. Please commit to being part of the solution every day not just the days a woman’s murder goes viral. Don’t just tell them not to go anywhere alone in the dark or to carry a pepper spray or just give them suggestions on how to stay safe like it isn’t always on their minds. Help educate your friends and family.   
Care more about the safety of women than being called a simp. Don’t just care about the women you’re attracted to or related to.

All this isn’t just about proving that 'not all men' are part of the problem, it’s about ensuring that more men become part of the solution. We can’t afford to be passive observers. It’s time for real action.",56,6,2024-08-18,sarumanismyboi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ev4xkv/how_a_common_man_can_make_a_difference_in/,how a common man can make a difference in

india,year,The opt-out conundrum: Analysis of web scraping to train AI models | Internet Freedom Foundation,"https://preview.redd.it/93al3jjazx7e1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=201cbf0cbb2ce15184fc84bc04814b9e05a850de

# tl;dr

Social media companies have recently seen an exponential increase in the use of AI. The companies have been accused of scraping data from their users for training these AI models without obtaining explicit consent from their users. In our post, we discuss these concerns which are being raised in various jurisdictions and whether opting out is a choice given to us by the law. 

# Background 

Beginning last year, there have been multiple revelations regarding social media platforms using user data to train their own AI models. In most cases, users were not explicitly notified that their data was being used to train AI models. In the past few months, revelations surrounding social media platforms using user data to train their AI models have led to public outcry. 

In September 2023, Meta [announced](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/privacy-matters-metas-generative-ai-features/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) the launch of its new generative AI feature. The announcement states that considering generative AI takes a large amount of data to train, it used publicly shared posts from Instagram and Facebook, including photos and text, as data to train its generative AI models. In mid June 2024, Meta [informed](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw99n3qjeyjo?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) its users in the European Union (“**EU**”) and the United Kingdom (“**UK**”) that it has made changes to its privacy policy allowing it to use their information to develop and improve its AI products. This led to public opposition and complaints being filed before data protection authorities across Europe. In September 2024, before an inquiry by the Australian Senate, Meta’s global privacy director [admitted](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-11/facebook-scraping-photos-data-no-opt-out/104336170?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to scraping data of Australian adults to train its AI models from as early as 2007 without providing an opt out option. 

Further, in September 2024, 404media [reported](https://www.404media.co/linkedin-is-training-ai-on-user-data-before-updating-its-terms-of-service/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) that LinkedIn introduced a new privacy setting saying that data from the platform is being used to train AI models, without simultaneously updating its privacy policy. LinkedIn has since then updated its [privacy policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?ref=static.internetfreedom.in#use) to state that “*We may use your personal data to improve, develop, and provide products and Services, develop and train artificial intelligence (AI) models, develop, provide, and personalize our Services, and gain insights with the help of AI, automated systems, and inferences, so that our Services can be more relevant and useful to you and others.*”. 

In September 2024, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published a [report](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Social-Media-6b-Report-9-11-2024.pdf?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) on the surveillance activities of nine of the largest social media and video streaming services, namely Amazon, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Snap, ByteDance, Discord, Reddit, and WhatsApp. The report highlighted that these platforms conduct extensive surveillance, gathering such vast amounts of data that they are unable to fully identify all the data points they collect or all the third parties with whom they share this information. Such incidents have shown that companies around the world have been silently scraping our data and training their AI models, which makes us question what we can do to prevent them from doing so.

# Navigating the Opting Out Maze

The fact remains that in India, and most other jurisdictions barring the EU, social media platforms have not asked for explicit consent before using user data to train AI models. However, there are opt out mechanisms that social media platforms offer to allow users to halt access to their data by the platform for training AI models or any other purpose. Unfortunately, the opt out options mostly only let you stop some future data grabbing, not whatever happened in the past. Further, companies behind AI chatbots often do not provide details about what ‘training’ or ‘improving’ their AI models means in relation to your interactions. As a result, it's unclear what you are actually opting out of if you choose to do so. 

While social media platforms do provide some vague opt out mechanisms for preventing companies from using your data to train their AI models, these are often not made plainly available and require the user to delve into the minute wordings of the application’s settings and permissions. 

Let’s try to break down some ways in which you can opt out: 

1. **LinkedIn**

LinkedIn wrote [on its help page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6278444?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) that it uses generative AI for purposes like writing assistant features. We can revoke permission by heading to the Data privacy tab in your account settings and clicking on “[Data for Generative AI Improvement](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/settings/data-for-ai-improvement?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)” to find the toggle. Turn it to “off” to opt out. 

The FAQ regarding its AI training states that it employs ""privacy-enhancing technologies to redact or remove personal data"" from its training datasets and that it does not train its models on individuals residing in the EU, EEA, or Switzerland.

1. **X**

X, formerly known as Twitter, automatically activated a setting that allowed the company to train its Grok AI on users’ posts. X enabled the new setting by default. On X, you can click [Privacy](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/26/heres-how-to-disable-x-twitter-from-using-your-data-to-train-its-grok-ai/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), then Data sharing and personalization: there you'll find a permission checkbox that you can uncheck to stop X's Grok A.I. model from using your account data “for training and fine-tuning,” as well as an option to clear past personal data that may have been used before you opted out.

1. **Meta**

This year, Meta [reignited](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/meta-reignites-plans-to-train-ai-using-uk-users-public-facebook-and-instagram-posts/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) its controversial plans to use the public posts of Facebook and Instagram users as AI training data. This resulted in both good and bad news. The bad news was that users in the US or other countries without national data privacy laws had no foolproof way to prevent Meta from using their data to train AI, which has likely already been done. Meta does not offer an opt-out feature for people living in these regions. The good news, however, was for users in the European Union and the UK, which are protected by strict data protection laws. They have the right to object to their data being scraped, allowing them to opt out more easily.

1. **Bluesky**

Recently, social networking platform Bluesky said that, unlike other social media platforms, it would not rely on user content to train generative artificial intelligence (AI) models. However, it was [pointed out](https://www.404media.co/someone-made-a-dataset-of-one-million-bluesky-posts-for-machine-learning-research/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) by some users that Bluesky itself does not train AI models on user data, it just does not prevent others from using its data for training purposes. The company responded that just like other open websites on the internet, it is considering implementing a consent system for how other companies access Bluesky users' data. The proposed system would let Bluesky users indicate whether they consent to their content being used for AI training. 

It also makes us wonder how AI chatbots are utilising our data where people are choosing to share personal information. Read more about this [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/31/opt-out-ai-training-meta-chatgpt/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

# Is opting out mandated by a law? Perspectives from around the globe

Social media companies do not tend to divulge much about their AI refinement and training processes, which makes it harder to make an informed choice about opting out. This raises the question: is opting out even mandated by law, or is it a choice that companies can make?

There are varying answers depending on the jurisdiction. 

For those living in the United States, where online privacy laws are not as strict, companies can use public posts to train their A.I. This was noticed when Meta launched its new generative AI feature and technically were not required to notify users, and therefore users may not have realized that it had been training its A.I. with their public posts. So, if you want to opt out, you have to make your account private. Meta later also clarified that [private messages](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai/) between family and friends are not used to train its AI.

Those using Meta apps within the European Union, Britain, the European Economic Area and Switzerland were notified that they could opt out, according to Meta. These jurisdictions are protected by strict [data protection](https://www.gtlaw-dataprivacydish.com/2023/06/what-gdpr-requirements-does-a-company-that-uses-personal-information-to-train-an-artificial-intelligence-ai-need-to-meet/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) regimes, users have the right to object to their data being scraped, so they can opt out more easily. For instance, under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“**GDPR**”), [Article 14](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) states that individuals ought to be informed about the collection of their personal information (including the purpose of collection), even if this data has not been obtained from the individuals, i.e., inclusion of publicly available data. These and other obligations resulted in companies in the EU informing users about web scraping for the purpose of AI model training. 

Now, coming to India, we have the [Digital Personal Data Protection  Act, 2023](https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Digital%20Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Act%202023.pdf?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) (“**DPDP Act**”), which is yet to be operationalized. However, the DPDP Act excludes publicly available personal data from its scope. This means that AI entities scraping publicly available personal data for self-training may not be required to comply with data fiduciary obligations (e.g., obtaining prior consent). The DPDP Act does not require individuals to be notified about the collection and subsequent processing of data they might make publicly availab

is, generating public awareness about the potential use of public personal data for AI modelling and training, deepfake creation, and possibly commercialization without users’ knowledge is becoming critical.

Considering that India has just enacted its first data protection law (the DPDP Act), its adequacy to deal with emerging challenges such as web scrapping ought to be considered. The very fact that even if the DPDP Act were in force, companies can get away with using user data to train their AI models is evidence that this law is not equipped to deal with emerging threats to individuals’ data. Any new law, but specifically those that deal with new technologies must be future proof and equipped to handle any new threats to the rights it seeks to provide. There is a significant need for India to deeply consider whether the DPDP Act is sufficient to protect the personal data of individuals. Considering that we are still awaiting the issue of rules under the DPDP Act, the real efficacy of the law remains to be ascertained. 

Such trends exhibit that public social media posts are seen as fair game and can be hoovered into AI training data sets by anyone. Social media companies are conveniently relinquishing their responsibility by asking users who do not want their data to be used to set their account settings to private to minimize the risk. This implies that in practicality opt-outing settings mostly give the users an illusion of control. To counter this, data protection regimes around the world need to facilitate and build within themselves the right to object. The users need to have a clear method of opting out which is lacking in various jurisdictions presently.

analysis of web scraping to train ai models internet freedom foundation,tldr social media companies have recently seen an exponential increase in the use of ai the companies have been accused of scraping data from their users for training these ai models without obtaining explicit consent from their users in our post we discuss these concerns which are being raised in various jurisdictions and whether opting out is a choice given to us by the law background beginning last year there have been multiple revelations regarding social media platforms using user data to train their own ai models in most cases users were not explicitly notified that their data was being used to train ai models in the past few months revelations surrounding social media platforms using user data to train their ai models have led to public outcry in september meta announced the launch of its new generative ai feature the announcement states that considering generative ai takes a large amount of data to train it used publicly shared posts from instagram and facebook including photos and text as data to train its generative ai models in mid june meta informed its users in the european union eu and the united kingdom uk that it has made changes to its privacy policy allowing it to use their information to develop and improve its ai products this led to public opposition and complaints being filed before data protection authorities across europe in september before an inquiry by the australian senate metas global privacy director admitted to scraping data of australian adults to train its ai models from as early as without providing an opt out option further in september media reported that linkedin introduced a new privacy setting saying that data from the platform is being used to train ai models without simultaneously updating its privacy policy linkedin has since then updated its privacy policy to state that we may use your personal data to improve develop and provide products and services develop and train artificial intelligence ai models develop provide and personalize our services and gain insights with the help of ai automated systems and inferences so that our services can be more relevant and useful to you and others in september the us federal trade commission ftc published a report on the surveillance activities of nine of the largest social media and video streaming services namely amazon facebook youtube twitter snap bytedance discord reddit and whatsapp the report highlighted that these platforms conduct extensive surveillance gathering such vast amounts of data that they are unable to fully identify all the data points they collect or all the third parties with whom they share this information such incidents have shown that companies around the world have been silently scraping our data and training their ai models which makes us question what we can do to prevent them from doing so navigating the opting out maze the fact remains that in india and most other jurisdictions barring the eu social media platforms have not asked for explicit consent before using user data to train ai models however there are opt out mechanisms that social media platforms offer to allow users to halt access to their data by the platform for training ai models or any other purpose unfortunately the opt out options mostly only let you stop some future data grabbing not whatever happened in the past further companies behind ai chatbots often do not provide details about what training or improving their ai models means in relation to your interactions as a result its unclear what you are actually opting out of if you choose to do so while social media platforms do provide some vague opt out mechanisms for preventing companies from using your data to train their ai models these are often not made plainly available and require the user to delve into the minute wordings of the applications settings and permissions lets try to break down some ways in which you can opt out linkedin linkedin wrote on its help page that it uses generative ai for purposes like writing assistant features we can revoke permission by heading to the data privacy tab in your account settings and clicking on data for generative ai improvement to find the toggle turn it to off to opt out the faq regarding its ai training states that it employs privacyenhancing technologies to redact or remove personal data from its training datasets and that it does not train its models on individuals residing in the eu eea or switzerland x x formerly known as twitter automatically activated a setting that allowed the company to train its grok ai on users posts x enabled the new setting by default on x you can click privacy then data sharing and personalization there youll find a permission checkbox that you can uncheck to stop xs grok ai model from using your account data for training and finetuning as well as an option to clear past personal data that may have been used before you opted out meta this year meta reignited its controversial plans to use the public posts of facebook and instagram users as ai training data this resulted in both good and bad news the bad news was that users in the us or other countries without national data privacy laws had no foolproof way to prevent meta from using their data to train ai which has likely already been done meta does not offer an optout feature for people living in these regions the good news however was for users in the european union and the uk which are protected by strict data protection laws they have the right to object to their data being scraped allowing them to opt out more easily bluesky recently social networking platform bluesky said that unlike other social media platforms it would not rely on user content to train generative artificial intelligence ai models however it was pointed out by some users that bluesky itself does not train ai models on user data it just does not prevent others from using its data for training purposes the company responded that just like other open websites on the internet it is considering implementing a consent system for how other companies access bluesky users data the proposed system would let bluesky users indicate whether they consent to their content being used for ai training it also makes us wonder how ai chatbots are utilising our data where people are choosing to share personal information read more about this here is opting out mandated by a law perspectives from around the globe social media companies do not tend to divulge much about their ai refinement and training processes which makes it harder to make an informed choice about opting out this raises the question is opting out even mandated by law or is it a choice that companies can make there are varying answers depending on the jurisdiction for those living in the united states where online privacy laws are not as strict companies can use public posts to train their ai this was noticed when meta launched its new generative ai feature and technically were not required to notify users and therefore users may not have realized that it had been training its ai with their public posts so if you want to opt out you have to make your account private meta later also clarified that private messages between family and friends are not used to train its ai those using meta apps within the european union britain the european economic area and switzerland were notified that they could opt out according to meta these jurisdictions are protected by strict data protection regimes users have the right to object to their data being scraped so they can opt out more easily for instance under the eus general data protection regulation gdpr article states that individuals ought to be informed about the collection of their personal information including the purpose of collection even if this data has not been obtained from the individuals ie inclusion of publicly available data these and other obligations resulted in companies in the eu informing users about web scraping for the purpose of ai model training now coming to india we have the digital personal data protection act dpdp act which is yet to be operationalized however the dpdp act excludes publicly available personal data from its scope this means that ai entities scraping publicly available personal data for selftraining may not be required to comply with data fiduciary obligations eg obtaining prior consent the dpdp act does not require individuals to be notified about the collection and subsequent processing of data they might make publicly availab is generating public awareness about the potential use of public personal data for ai modelling and training deepfake creation and possibly commercialization without users knowledge is becoming critical considering that india has just enacted its first data protection law the dpdp act its adequacy to deal with emerging challenges such as web scrapping ought to be considered the very fact that even if the dpdp act were in force companies can get away with using user data to train their ai models is evidence that this law is not equipped to deal with emerging threats to individuals data any new law but specifically those that deal with new technologies must be future proof and equipped to handle any new threats to the rights it seeks to provide there is a significant need for india to deeply consider whether the dpdp act is sufficient to protect the personal data of individuals considering that we are still awaiting the issue of rules under the dpdp act the real efficacy of the law remains to be ascertained such trends exhibit that public social media posts are seen as fair game and can be hoovered into ai training data sets by anyone social media companies are conveniently relinquishing their responsibility by asking users who do not want their data to be used to set their account settings to private to minimize the risk this implies that in practicality optouting settings mostly give the users an illusion of control to counter this

# tl;dr

The Digital Media Policy, 2024 recently released by the Uttar Pradesh government garnered significant attention but it's not the only one which exists. This post compares and contrasts state-level digital media/influencer-centric policies of five Indian states. State governments as well as the Union government have come up with different variations of the media/ influencer policies to disseminate information about government schemes, welfare benefits, and achievements. We aim to evaluate these policies by examining their transparency, accountability, and impact on fundamental freedoms and rights within the information ecosystem. Additionally, we will consider the effect of the propagation of the government ""schemes and achievements"" through the financial incentivisation of influencers and digital creators

# Why should you care? 

These policies incentivise influencers to promote state-approved narratives by using public funds. This approach can lead to self-censorship and moral policing, and stifle creativity and free speech while influencing public perceptions of government policies and welfare schemes. This inherently creates an uneven playing field, favouring empanelled influencers over those critical of the government and solely relying on platforms like Meta or YouTube as a source of income. Furthermore, the lack of transparency around paid partnerships means audiences are often unaware that they are consuming government-funded content which limits their capacity to make informed choices. Furthermore, the ambiguous definitions of what constitutes ""objectionable"" content open the door to arbitrary cancellation and legal actions against the empanelled influencers when most of these policies have no redressal system in place to defend against such actions.



# Background 



On August 28, 2024, [reports](https://x.com/internetfreedom/status/1828741543403860257) started surfacing about Uttar Pradesh (UP) government introducing a Digital Media Policy, 2024, with speculations that it will offer financial incentives to digital creators/influencers for promoting government schemes, and impose fines on certain objectionable content created by them. Notably, the Policy itself had not been officially placed in the public domain by the UP government but had to be obtained from unofficial channels (the original Hindi policy document is archived [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ylqFd8xVfDNrc8h1ibTxoJPVkUgwd6C/view?usp=sharing)). The Policy, as reported, aims at incentivising digital influencers to promote state schemes and achievements on online platforms. This prompted a debate \[[here](https://www.thequint.com/opinion/up-digital-media-policy-incentivises-content-creators-but-to-what-end#read-more) and [here](https://www.boomlive.in/decode/ups-new-policy-pays-content-creators-big-bucksbut-at-what-cost-26452)\] regarding its impact on freedom of speech and expression. Following this development and the discourse around it, we attempted to analyse and research the digital media/ influencer policies of four other states namely [Haryana](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12sKIS_nqcNqV5cXF7H0h4a4P23eim1O9/view?usp=sharing), [Karnataka](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zsmu3TlqDjKo0ZogwX19_pwKZZ_OwAln/view?usp=sharing), [Punjab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ECYH3NmG44-qU6Hd2mfT-PxahwkOBZ7/view?usp=sharing), and [Himachal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ojZ7fO7qvuGQhx6YTo8RO_xRvT3ewfJS/view?usp=sharing) Pradesh. As part of this post, we are releasing a [table](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14mKOlY_oyIQfoo1_76O-SWwh7DgL9Fwa/view?usp=sharing) summarising and comparing the policies for the aforementioned 5 states.  

# Uttar Pradesh Digital Media Policy, 2024  [[Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ylqFd8xVfDNrc8h1ibTxoJPVkUgwd6C/view?usp=sharing)]



1. **Stated purpose/aim:** To disseminate information about various developmental, public welfare/beneficial schemes or achievements by the state and the benefits thereof to the people of the state. 
2. **Medium of dissemination:** through digital media platforms and other similar social media platforms.
3. **Target audience for empanelment/ enlistment:** Digital media handle/page/channel/account holder/operator/ digital media influencers/content writers and related agencies or firms. 
4. **Specified criteria for empanelment**: Applicants must have been in existence for at least two years and must submit their digital media analytics reports from the last six months. Additionally, they are required to provide a self-declaration form asserting that they have no criminal cases against them, as well as another self-declaration form confirming that all information provided for the purpose of listing is true. They must also possess the necessary equipment to produce videos, posts, and other content.
5. **Payment conditions**: Payments will depend on the number of views and reach to the general public, which will be evaluated on the basis of the metrics provided by the content creators. The content creator will have to assure the state that the views are original through an affidavit. At this stage, no transparency safeguards have been built into the Policy to ensure that creators do not file false affidavits. Limiting the information about which creator/influencer is empanelled/enlisted to the State Government restricts individuals/users or even independent authorities from conducting checks on the authenticity of the creator’s followers/subscribers and content views/engagement. Payment will be done according to the categories (A, B, C, or D), type of content, and platform. For Facebook and Instagram, longer content will get higher payments and additional bonuses for exceeding 1 lakh views. For X, influencers will be paid extra for high engagement. Each category has a maximum monthly expenditure limit for advertisements. 
6. **Grounds for cancellation**: As per the Policy, in case the information provided by the account holder/influencer is found to be incorrect/false, then the empanelment will stand cancelled. Here, it is unclear how the government (or who in the government) will ascertain that the provided information is accurate. If this role is assigned to a person from the UP government, then content produced in favour of the government (even if inaccurate or exaggerated) may be allowed. Similarly, accurate content/information about state-level schemes that do not show the government in a positive light may be falsely considered incorrect/inaccurate and thus may be used as grounds for cancellation of the enlistment contract. No safeguards or checks have been introduced in the Policy (in the form of an independent committee for content review, publication of cancellation order, or appeal/grievance redressal mechanisms for influencers) to ensure that the Policy is not (mis)used by state officials to propagate their preferred narrative online and restrict speech unpalatable to the state government.

# Haryana Digital Media Advertisement Policy, 2023 [[Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12sKIS_nqcNqV5cXF7H0h4a4P23eim1O9/view?usp=sharing)]

The Haryana Government shared an ‘[Invitation for Empanelment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12sKIS_nqcNqV5cXF7H0h4a4P23eim1O9/view)’ to invite prominent social media channels to participate in the empanelment process under the ‘Haryana Digital Media Advertisement Policy 2023’.



1. **Stated purpose/aim:** To disseminate information about governmental welfare policies with the aim that it reaches the masses at an optimum level and to regulate such information/advertisement. 
2. **Medium of dissemination:** Through various digital media platforms, including social media news channels, websites, and other reputable channels.
3. **Target audience for empanelment/ enlistment:** Legal entities owning the social media channels, websites, and reputed social media channels and the individual owners of social media channels, websites, and reputed social media channels. 
4. **Specified criteria for empanelment**: Applicants must have been operating under the same name for at least one year and are required to submit their digital media analytics reports for the last 12 months. They must also provide a self-declaration form asserting that they have never been in dispute, blacklisted, or de-empanelled, along with another self-declaration form confirming that all information provided for the listing is accurate. Additionally, applicants located outside Haryana must include a certificate issued by the Director General of Directorate of Information, Public Relations & Languages, Haryana (“DIPRL”). They must have at least 50,000 followers or subscribers and have posted a minimum of 30 times per month in the six months preceding their application.
5. **Payment conditions**: Payments will depend on the number of views and reach. Up to 5% of the total followers/subscribers reach is required one month before the payment is made which will be evaluated on the basis of the analytics report provided by the content creators. At this stage, no transparency safeguards have been built into the Policy to ensure creators do not file false analytics reports. Relevant deductions to the advertisement rates shall be made if the content fails to reach 5 per cent of the subscribers/ followers. The Policy does not specify the rates or methods for deductions, which means that content creators may face uncertainty about the final amount they will be paid. Additionally, since the discretion for deductions lies entirely with the state, there is a risk that the state could impose significant deductions based on its personal preferences or dissatisfaction with the content creators, potentially using this as a means to pressure creators.
6. **Grounds for cancellation:** As per the Policy, if any information provided is found to be false or incorrect, the empanelment will be immediately cancelled. However, the Policy does not clarify whether the DIPRL or the Panel Advisory Committee, which reviews applications, will determine the accuracy of the information. If a website broadcasts objectionable content—such as hate speech, pornography, violence, indecent or abusive material, drug-related content, cruel or insensitive topics, personal disputes, fake news, false propaganda, promotional interviews, or any other inappropriate content—the empanelment will be revoked/ suspended, and the channel will be blacklisted for a minimum of six months. In order to avoid revocation of their empanelment on broad and ambiguous grounds such as “false propaganda” or “insensitive topic”, influencers may lead to proactive or self-imposed censorship creating a chilling effect on online speech. Additionally, empanelment will be cancelled if the website refuses to display specified ads or if its unique user count decreases by 10% upon re-evaluation. Re-listing will be prohibited for six months following cancellation. The Policy also lacks clarity on whether the DIPRL or the state government will inform the content creator about the objectionable content, or if the state government will notify the DIPRL, which will then take appropriate action against the channel. 



# Karnataka Digital Advertising Guidelines, 2024 [[Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zsmu3TlqDjKo0ZogwX19_pwKZZ_OwAln/view?usp=sharing)] 



1. **Stated purpose/ aim:** To make use of digital advertising to propagate the government’s policies and schemes to internet users. The existing traditional media advertising policy is inadequate to handle digital advertising which has a completely different set of dynamics compared to traditional mass media. 
2. **Medium of dissemination:** Through digital media entities which include social media platforms, video streaming, over-the-top (“OTT”) platforms, and influencers, as well as through a digital advertising agency. 
3. **Target audience for empanelment/ enlistment:** The guidelines list 14 categories of digital entities which are eligible for empanelment—video streaming platforms, “OTT” platforms, social media platforms, influencers, and other digital entities. 
4. **Specified criteria for empanelment**: The digital advertising agency must be either incorporated in Karnataka or must have a fully operational office in Karnataka. It should be at least 2 years old at the time of empanelling and should have a valid contract/agreement with Google, Meta or respective digital media entities to carry out digital advertising for governments on their platforms. In the case of a digital media entity, it must be a legally incorporated entity with the Registrar of Companies, Government of India. It should be at least one year old at the time of empanelling and continuously publishing content without any break for at least one year.
5. **Payment conditions**: Prices for the guidelines will be decided as per the rates specified by the Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity (“DAVP”) for each individual format/category. In such cases where the prices are dynamic in nature, the guidelines allow for independent pricing to be followed on a case-by-case basis along the lines of DAVP rates for the same.
6. **Grounds for cancellation**: The guidelines do not explicitly mention any reason for suspension of empanelment. However, in case of eligibility for digital media entity, it has been mentioned that the entity should be compliant with all statutory requirements of state or Union governments or its agencies, failing which the empanelment shall be cancelled. It should also not be publishing any content–text, visuals, audio or any such–which violates Indian law. Notably, no safeguards/checks have been introduced in the guidelines (in the form of an independent committee for content review, publication of cancellation order, or appeal/ grievance redressal mechanisms for the digital entities) to ensure that the Policy is not misused by the state to propagate their preferred narrative online and restrict speech unpalatable to the state government. 

# Punjab 

The Punjab Influencer Empanelment Policy, 2023 \[[**Link**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ECYH3NmG44-qU6Hd2mfT-PxahwkOBZ7/view?usp=sharing)\]



1. **Stated purpose/ aim:** To promote Punjab in a positive light, highlighting its governance, culture, heritage, and attractions.
2. **Medium of dissemination:** Through various social media platforms, namely, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, Facebook & YouTube. 
3. **Target audience for empanelment/ enlistment:** Influencers who have built a reputation for themselves on any of the social media channels where the content is published in their own name or company they own.
4. **Specified criteria for empanelment**: The influencer shall be active on social media for a minimum period of 6 months before the start date of application and should have at least 10,000 combined subscribers on the date of submission of application for empanelment. The influencers should also not have any criminal cases against them and must adhere to ethical guidelines (Annexure A of the Policy) when promoting products or ideas. Annexure A mentions that the ‘content should promote Punjab in a positive light’. The Policy tries to impose stringent conditions on influencers such as restrictions on posting any content that is “anti-national, or against the state's interests”, leading to concerns about subjective interpretation by the state.  
5. **Payment conditions**: Payment will be done according to the categories (A, B, C, D or E) based on a combined verified social media subscriber base. The rates for the Policy are determined on cost per view (within the prescribed time period of 4 days) for every category. Accordingly, the minimum base rate with respect to the number of views has been fixed for every category.
6. **Grounds for cancellation**: Suspension of empanelment may be done on the grounds of hate speech, violent content, adult nudity and sexual activity, intoxicants (liquor), cruel and insensitive content, personal disputes, false news, misrepresentation, promotional interviews, or any other objectionable material, or violation of any law enforced in India leading to loss of reputation of the State Government or any of its bodies. Any of these grounds could lead to immediate suspension of empanelment and blacklisting. No penal action is explicitly mentioned in the Policy. The inclusion of terms like “false news” and “misrepresentation” lacks specificity and opens the door to potential misuse and arbitrary as well as subjective enforcement. However, the Policy provides that the influencer shall have the right to appeal before the Government, or any officer authorised by it in this regard, against any order passed by the Competent Authority under this Policy.

# The Himachal Pradesh Digital Media Policy, 2024 [[Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ojZ7fO7qvuGQhx6YTo8RO_xRvT3ewfJS/view?usp=sharing)] 



1. **Stated purpose/ aim:** To optimally utilise the news web channels, news web portals and social media influencers/handlers to publicise and promote the policies, programmes and development initiatives of the State Government.
2. **Medium of dissemination:** Through digital media entities which include social media platforms, news web channels, news websites/web portals and influencers/handlers. 
3. **Target audience for empanelment/ enlistment:** The Policy lists 3 types of digital platforms which are eligible for empanelment—news web channels, news websites/portals, social media platforms and influencers/handlers. 
4. **Specified criteria for empanelment**: Social media influencers/handlers must have earned at least 50 per cent of subscribers or followers at least six months prior to the date of application for enlistment. They are segmented into 4 categories (A, B, C, D) based on the number of subscribers/ followers. 
5. **Payment conditions**: In the case of social media influencers, payment will be done according to the categories (A, B, C, D) and the maximum amount prescribed is 2 lakhs for Category A. There is further sub-classification created based on the different social media platforms (YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, Twitter), and the rates for the same are determined based on the type of content and duration of the same. 
6. **Grounds for cancellation**: Suspension of empanelment may be done on the grounds of hate speech, violent content, cruel and insensitive content, false/fake news, anti-state/anti-national content sharing, misrepresentation and any other objectionable material. Indulging in these activities after empanelment will make the entity liable for cancellation of the empanelment and penal action.



Grounds for cancellation such as ""anti-state/anti-national content"" and ""false/fake News"" lack specificity and open the door to potential misuse and arbitrary as well as subjective enforcement. The Policy also lacks safeguards or checks, such as an independent committee for content review, publication of cancellation orders, or appeal/grievance redressal mechanisms for digital entities. This absence raises concerns about the Policy being misused by the state to promote its preferred narrative online and suppress speech that it finds unfavourable or unpalatable. It also includes provisions for penal action but does not provide details about the action that can be taken. Such an overreaching provision may have chilling effects on online speech and freedom of speech and expression.

# States with unpublished digital media policies

As per media reports, similar initiatives to empanel social media influencers to advertise government schemes have also been undertaken by [Rajasthan](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-government-advertises-on-social-media-influencers-for-accessibility-to-social-welfare-schemes-and-assembly-elections-101688153348586.html), [Assam](https://www.northeasttoday.in/2024/02/23/assam-government-likely-to-introduce-social-media-influencer-bill-to-collaborate-with-content-creators/), and [Sikkim](https://yojanaregistration.co.in/sikkim-creatorpreneur-yojana/). However, these policies are not available in the public domain. The failure to publicly provide accessible and comprehensive policy documents undermines the state’s transparency and accountability towards citizens. Publicly available policies are essential to ensure that such programs are implemented fairly and effectively. Clear documentation and open channels for public feedback would help mitigate its potential misuse and ensure its ethical and effective implementation. IFF has filed Right to Information (RTI) applications with [Rajasthan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19UB3JN03Nwt0q8JDntQwwHlFCG1ljAL_/view), [Assam](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xBkC9OKtS5mJY56s9NGqKKBd11B7Z167/view) and [Sikkim](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13PPWjf9tOGepaX_v3crON2SBrliDaEwK/view) seeking copies of the policy documents and asking whether a public consultation was conducted for these policies. 

# Do these models influence free speech and open internet?

States’ digital media and influencer policies must be evaluated from a user-centric and rights-based perspective, as they often prioritise government interests over those of users. By rewarding influencers solely based on follower counts and relying on broad, ambiguous contractual terms, these policies undermine expertise and objectivity, creating a biased landscape that favours state-approved narratives. This can lead to self-censorship and moral policing, and stifle creativity and free speech while influencing public perceptions of government policies and welfare schemes. Through such policies, highlighting the government's ""schemes and achievements"" is being financially incentivised and the focus is only on positive government-approved narratives. Legally, there is nothing unsound or wrong with this approach—it is similar to advertising, which government departments routinely engage in themselves. However, public funds are being used to incentivise a certain kind and category of content over the other, which is capable of going ‘viral’ (given the popularity of digital creators involved) and potentially skewing the narrative. This inherently creates an uneven playing field, favouring empanelled influencers over those critical of the government and solely relying on platforms like Meta or YouTube as a source of income. 

There are a number of transparency concerns with such a model as well, like there may not be an obligation to disclose ads/paid partnerships, and thus the audience may not realise these creators are being paid by the government. While it might get revised in the future, the policies raise concerns in their current form. To ensure transparency, there should be clear disclaimers—and not only vague labels like “paid partnership”—so people clearly understand that a creator is receiving government payouts. The lack of transparency regarding the paid nature of content diminishes users’ ability to make informed choices. Further, those who critique state governments or their initiatives may be sidelined, dominated, or even subjugated, leading to a distorted public discourse where the true implications of the policies and schemes are concealed, and informed debate is stifled. 

In the case of [*Common Cause v. Union of India*](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/177370809/), the Supreme Court of India laid down guidelines to restrain the Union of India and all state governments from using public funds on government advertisements which are primarily intended to project individual functionaries of the government or a political party. The Court-appointed Committee came up with ‘Guidelines on Content Regulation of Government Advertising’, which mentions 5 principles of content regulation: 

i) advertising campaigns are to be related to government responsibilities,

ii) materials should be presented in an objective, fair and accessible manner and designed to meet the objectives of the campaign,

iii) not directed at promoting political interests of a Party,

iv) campaigns must be justified and undertaken in an efficient and cost- effective manner and

v) advertisements must comply with legal requirements and financial regulations and procedures.

For enforcement of these guidelines, the government set up the Committee on Content Regulation in Government Advertising and decided that their implementation would proceed proactively, *suo moto* or on a complaint. However there has been [criticism](https://caravanmagazine.in/government-policy/centre-state-governments-flouting-sc-regulations-government-ads) that the Committee has failed to enforce the guidelines regularly, with the last action probably taken back in [2020](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1651999). This points to a lack of enforcement mechanisms, which offers no real remedy. 



Most of the state policies are sprinkled with a vague penalty provision (as it fails to define the terms such as immoral, objectionable etc, exhaustively) which allows for suspension/cancellation of empanelment of those who post objectionable material against the government. The inclusion of such terms creates ambiguity in the enforcement of these policies, and most of these have no redressal system in place to remedy erroneous cancellations. 



The Ministry of Consumer Affairs released the [Guidelines for Prevention of Misleading Advertisements and Endorsements for Misleading Advertisements, 2022](https://consumeraffairs.nic.in/sites/default/files/file-uploads/latestnews/CCPA%20Notification.pdf), which attempts to promote ethical advertising and consumer protection. These guidelines stipulate the requirements for the content, style, and format of disclaimers that influencers must include in their product ads, introducing a much-required safeguard that furthers transparency. They also mention certain conditions for non-misleading and valid advertisements (“ads”) such as truthful and honest representation. However, is it unclear how these guidelines are operationalised and how effective they are in safeguarding transparency and accountability. 



The aim of digital media/influencer policies should be to have provisions in place not only to enhance accountability but also to ensure that influencers can engage in open discourse without fear of punitive or disproportionate repercussions. States must create a transparent, equitable, and trustworthy environment that maximises the positive impact of social media influencers, ultimately fostering a healthier online information ecosystem where user interests and rights are respected.

india,year,IFF's Statement on ICC's Ruling to Impose Penalty of ₹213.14 cr  on Meta for Abusing its Dominant Position via WhatsApp's 2021 Privacy Policy,"# Statement



The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has[ imposed ](https://www.cci.gov.in/antitrust/press-release/details/451)a landmark penalty of ₹213.14 crore (approximately $25.25 million) on Meta for exploiting its dominant position through WhatsApp’s 2021 Privacy Policy update. IFF [submitted](https://internetfreedom.in/big-opportunity-cci-accepts-iffs-expert-information/) expert information as an informant before the CCI. This ruling is a significant step in holding Big Tech accountable for its impact on user privacy and competition in India.



We welcome the CCI’s historic ruling, which imposes a penalty on Meta for abusing its market dominance through WhatsApp’s 2021 Privacy Policy update. The policy update, which compelled users to accept expanded data collection and sharing within the Meta group on a 'take-it-or-leave-it' basis, violated user autonomy by offering no opt-out option. The ruling reinforces the need for greater accountability from tech giants, ensuring that users' rights are protected, and the principles of fair competition are upheld in digital markets.



The CCI found that Meta’s actions violated Indian competition law under Section 4(2)(a)(i) by imposing unfair conditions and abusing its dominant position in the market. Importantly, this marks the first instance outside the EU where a competition regulator has fined Big Tech for exploiting its dominant position through privacy practices. The decision highlights the growing recognition of privacy as a key issue in competition law.



By holding Meta accountable, the CCI has set a landmark precedent for the protection of privacy and fair competition. This is a critical step in ensuring that tech giants cannot exploit their market power at the expense of users’ fundamental rights.



This victory is the result of years of sustained advocacy, beginning in 2021. It underscores the essential role of persistence in defending users’ fundamental rights and the collective responsibility required to challenge the unchecked power of Big Tech. While this is a significant step forward, our commitment to advancing digital rights remains steadfast. This is a long-term effort, and we are firmly committed to seeing it through to positive, tangible outcomes. 



This was our first matter before the Competition Commission of India. We were represented by the legal team at Sarvada Legal, and we extend our sincere gratitude to Advocates Abir Roy, Vivek Pandey, and Biyanka Bhatia for their dedicated efforts and professional guidance. They were assisted by IFF’s in-house legal team including Advocates Apar Gupta, Anandita Mishra, Krishnesh Bapat, Gayatri Malhotra and Freedom Innovation Fellows Medha Garg and Rubayya Tasneem.

india,year,The Ominous Parallels: Soviet Penetration Strategies and Present-day Russian Influence in India ,"India finds itself in a geopolitical crossfire reminiscent of an earlier era, one that many would prefer to forget. The 1985 CIA paper, *“*[The Soviets in India: Moscow’s Major Penetration Program](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86T00586R000400490007-7.pdf)*,”* stands out as a stark warning. Then, the Soviet Union’s strategies to embed influence in India spanned financial incentives, personal connections, and a calculated media campaign. Now, as India refines and re-exports Russian oil to Europe amidst diplomatic friction with Western nations, the parallels are hard to ignore.

The Soviets understood the power of money and its silent persuasion. Direct cash payments, subsidies for ideologically aligned publications, and kickbacks masquerading as business transactions were all part of their toolkit. Today, while the mechanisms have evolved, the undertone remains. Russia’s billions in unused rupees being funneled into Indian securities resemble the subtle yet effective economic foothold the Soviets once had. The trade relationship, particularly the crude oil supply chain, showcases this dynamic. India’s import and subsequent re-export of Russian oil may not seem politically charged on the surface, but it deepens dependency and financial entanglement—just as the Soviets engineered through inflated trade deals that funneled profits back to loyal political groups.

Relationships were another Soviet forte. Back then, cultivating personal ties with key officials allowed for the quiet steering of policy. Now, Russia’s interactions are more refined, layered behind high-level economic and strategic partnerships. But the effect is the same: influence without visibility. The recent surge of far-right activists and ideologically charged voices on traditional media and social media that push narratives aligning with Russian interests raises questions. Are these shifts organic, or are they echoes of a playbook meant to nudge India further from its democratic core?

The manipulation of public perception is where history echoes loudest. Soviet propaganda was a calculated attempt toward highlighting their shared interests with India and countering Western narratives. Fast-forward to today, and the chorus of skepticism toward Western nations, the amplified rhetoric of self-reliance, and the veiled critiques of democratic norms start to form a familiar pattern. The question becomes, who benefits when democratic values are eroded, and divisions widen? As before, the answer points towards Moscow.

The stakes are higher now. The world has seen the consequences of [Russian disinformation campaigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_disinformation)—fractured democracies and a diminished public trust. Indians must recognize that history has a way of repeating itself, and the signs are there for those who choose to look. The import isn’t just crude oil; it’s the quiet import of influence, one transaction at a time.

The warning is clear: democratic erosion doesn’t happen overnight. It creeps in, disguised as economic necessity, strategic convenience, or political rhetoric. The decision India faces is whether it will let this subtle shift continue, echoing a past that once sought to shape its future.

india,year,5 Reasons to Bring Back Indexation,"Budget 2024 saw Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman making several changes to the long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax. One of the critical changes was the removal of indexation benefits on the sale of property.

The deep fear is that removal of indexation benefits will significantly impact the real estate sector. Moreover, it could potentially increase tax burdens on citizens, especially the middle class. Here are five main reasons we need indexation.

**⮚ Reason 1: Indexation is Beneficial for Honest Taxpayers**

Indexation accounts for the decreased value of money over time because of inflation. This reduces the taxable amount due to capital gains and, thus, the resultant tax burden. The new proposal means that sellers will not be able to capture indexation’s benefit on their properties, translating into a 12.5% tax on the difference between the selling and original prices.
Moreover, buying a home is a big dream for India’s middle class. It’s purchased with a lot of sacrifices and struggles and usually on loans and EMIs. Thus, the actual amount paid for a home purchase is much higher than the property’s book value.
Now, if a person wants to sell such a home after some years, they have to bear an additional financial burden due to the new indexation proposal. This isn’t fair to either honest taxpayers or the middle class.

**⮚ Reason 2: Abrupt Jolt of a New Capital Gains Tax Regime**

The new proposals include giving a property seller the option of either a 20% LTCG rate with indexation, or a 12.5% LTCG rate without it. Properties purchased from 2001 onwards will be subject to a 12.5% LTCG tax upon sale. 

Since indexation accounts for inflation over time, it allows a property owner to determine its value more accurately. The sudden transition to a new regime will leave many property owners scratching their heads and unable to grasp the complex shifting sands of the new proposals.

**⮚ Reason 3: Risk of a Sectoral Slowdown**

The abrupt proposed change was not anticipated by the real estate sector, which was already struggling a bit. Urban real estate players are still recovering from Covid-19 induced shocks and resultant work from home mandates that has accelerated professional migration out of cities to native homes.

It’s highly probable that the removal of indexation benefits might significantly dent investor returns further, accelerating a real estate sectoral slowdown.

**⮚ Reason 4: Danger of Speculative Activities**

A BankBazaar study, which leveraged RBI’s House Price Index, found that without indexation, LTCG tax rose by three times on properties purchased after 2010.

In other words, an owner stands to benefit more from the new provisions if they sell the assets sooner (like 3-4 years) rather than holding it for a longer-time frame (say, 10 or more years). Thus, speculative or distress selloffs may shoot up, further destabilizing the real estate sector.

**⮚ Reason 5: Murky Practices may Flourish**

It’s possible that buyers and sellers may increasingly collude to underreport the real estate transaction value to lower capital gains on paper to reduce taxation. 
Moreover, black money activity may increase as sellers try various means to hide accrued unreported capital gains from real estate sales.

“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” is a popular saying. The indexation practice is a good working system that keeps all stakeholders satisfied. Dismantling it with a whimsical policy hammer will entrench multiple negative outcomes in the coming years.

india,year,Odisha Introduces Menstrual Leave for Women Employees,"[https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/national-news/odisha-introduces-menstrual-leave-for-women-employees-on-independence-day](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/national-news/odisha-introduces-menstrual-leave-for-women-employees-on-independence-day)

Published on: 15 Aug 2024, 3:42 am

BHUBANESWAR: The Odisha government has announced one-day menstrual leave for women employees working across state government and private sector. The policy unveiled by Odisha Deputy Chief Minister Pravati Parida during Independence Day celebrations in Cuttack, is effective immediately. It allows women to take leave on either first or second day of menstrual cycle. This reflects state’s commitment to supporting women’s health and well-being.

This development comes amidst ongoing national discussions about menstrual leave policies in India. Currently there is no national legislation addressing menstrual leave. However, Right of Women to Menstrual Leave and Free Access to Menstrual Health Products Bill 2022 proposes three days of paid leave for women and transwomen. This bill is still pending enactment. Supreme Court has recently urged central government to establish model policy on menstrual leave. They suggest such matters should be addressed through policy-making rather than judicial intervention.

Odisha's policy brings it in line with few other states and private companies that have adopted menstrual leave measures. Bihar and Kerala are only Indian states that have implemented menstrual leave policies so far. Bihar’s policy introduced in 1992, grants women two days of paid menstrual leave each month. Kerala in 2023, expanded its policy. It includes female students in all universities and institutions. It offers up to 60 days of maternity leave for female students over 18.

In addition, some private companies in India have also introduced menstrual leave. Zomato, for instance has been providing 10 days of paid period leave annually since 2020. Despite these advancements, there is still no comprehensive national law governing menstrual leave. Previous legislative efforts including Menstruation Benefits Bill, 2017 and Women’s Sexual Reproductive and Menstrual Rights Bill, 2018 have not passed. Odisha's new policy represents notable step forward in recognizing and addressing workplace needs of women.

india,year,OCI - time to scrap it? ,"Genuine question- why does India allow OCI card to anyone who is Indian origin or married to Indian origin person etc.? What is the benefit to India and to Indian citizens? 

Instead,  if India starts giving different visas like 3 month traveller's visa, 2 yr student visa, 3 yr  work visa, 3 year residency visa, 10 yr investment visa, then India retains much more control about who enters the country, who stays in the country etc. 

India can make money by charging fees for visa renewals. There will be employment for indian citizens to process these visa applications and their salaries will be covered by the additional fees.

Also, India already faces unemployment and competition for education.  Why do we give access to jobs and education via OCI to people who are not Indian citizens?
There could be work visas and study visas for certain highly qualified people but why give everyone a long term visa like it is a bhandara and everyone gets free food? No country does that. And we Indians do not get such unlimited access to jobs and education in any foreign country. So why should we give it to others?

Dual citizenship is offered only when both countries are equally developed. It is stupid to offer dual citizenship or OCI privileges to people who have discarded their Indian passport. When in times of conflict, their loyalty lies with their new country.

india,year,"The Role of Politics in India: Caste, Economy, and Accountability ","In recent times, India’s political landscape has seen significant shifts. Rahul Gandhi, often referred to as the “prince” of Indian politics, has been at the center of much debate. While some admire his commitment to social justice and his championing of the Constitution, others question the depth of his understanding and his priorities as a leader.

One of the criticisms leveled against him is his focus on caste-based issues. In a world where countries are advancing in research, development, and technology, Rahul’s emphasis on caste politics, especially the caste census, has raised eyebrows. While many agree that addressing the needs of marginalized communities is crucial, some believe that the real motive behind the caste census is not to uplift the oppressed, but to strengthen caste-based political strategies. They ask: if caste censuses really improved the lives of people, why haven't states like Bihar, which conducted such censuses, leapt ahead in terms of development?

Further, the question arises about the 2011 Socio-Economic Caste Census. The Congress, led by Rahul’s party at the time, chose not to publish its findings. Critics wonder why this vital data, which could have helped in policy-making, was kept under wraps.

Another point of contention is the lack of innovative policies to improve the lives of backward communities. Despite having studied abroad, Rahul has not introduced groundbreaking ideas for affirmative action or other methods to uplift the underprivileged. As India moves forward, many feel that the country needs new and advanced approaches to these issues, rather than old and divisive rhetoric.

Rahul Gandhi has also been vocal about local products, promising to take them global. For instance, he often talks about promoting Sopore’s apples on the international stage. Yet, there’s a question of consistency. In Himachal Pradesh, where his party holds power, similar products haven’t received the same attention. Why promote one region’s goods and not another’s?

Moreover, when it comes to addressing social issues like crime, Rahul has been selective in his responses. He has been outspoken about certain incidents across the country, yet during his party’s rule in Rajasthan, there was a horrific crime where a girl was burned alive in a brick kiln, and his response was muted. This selective activism has led to questions about his real motives – are these genuine concerns or political stunts?

But the criticism doesn’t stop with Rahul Gandhi. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has its own share of controversies. Over the past decade, the BJP has been in power, and while it has achieved many things, it has also been accused of brushing important issues under the rug. For instance, during the 2024 elections, the people pointed out the government’s silence on crucial matters, including the unrest in Manipur. The party has also been criticized for welcoming questionable individuals into its fold and seemingly ""cleansing"" their reputations once they joined.

Yet, some wonder if the Congress is any better. Despite claiming to represent a new and cleaner form of politics, they have welcomed individuals into their party who have been involved in controversial events. For example, those who supported the Kathua rape case accused were brought into the party. Likewise, leaders who made inflammatory remarks were retained in key positions.

Both the BJP and Congress have been accused of reckless spending of public funds. Critics argue that taxpayer money is being misused for political gains, with both parties offering freebies and benefits in a bid to win votes. This raises concerns about where such short-term solutions will lead the country in the long run.

Finally, Rahul’s frequent criticism of industrialists like Ambani and Adani raises questions about the consistency of his stance. He often points fingers at them, implying they’ve benefited unduly from the current government. However, many of his party’s leaders, and even coalition partners, have attended events hosted by these very industrialists, raising questions about the sincerity of these criticisms.

In the end, it’s clear that Indian politics is a complex mix of caste, economic priorities, and accountability. Leaders from both major parties have to answer tough questions about their strategies and policies. At its heart, the debate is not about individual politicians, but about the future of the country and the direction in which it’s headed.

india,year,Flexibility in Modern Hinduism ,"Maybe it's an unpopular opinion or something I have noticed selectively, but temples are very open to celebrations of national festivals. For example today on independace day, I saw saree of devi in tricolour, decorations around shiv temple with Indian flags and elements of tri colour in sweets or prasadam. 

I personally see it as a good sign that religion and nation can commingle to an extent that for some nation is religious but vice versa seems to be a scary proposition, I came across a video a few days ago where Pakistan which is formed on the very basis of Islam, it's people think religion comes before the nation. 

Which makes me wonder a few things:
1)  Is it only Hindus who show such nationalistic celebrations, I could be wrong or simply might have not encountered such things with let's say mosques or churches.

2) does it make you feel more comforted or is it offensive, some think it's not okay to include gods and godesses into such things, I mean how can a nation and religion mix. it's not just Pakistan and Islam but an interesting case study of US as well, where people are more religious and follow Catholicism, it was very easy for the church to interfere and influence into policies, they have sense then established the seperation of the state and matters of the church, simply put even Christians don't celebrate independance of America in their churches?

3) An unpopular opinion and tad bit controversial, but if a religion can celebrate a nation why can't a nation celebrate a religion? I don't mean lately we have started hiding behind the cloak of secularism and how India mainly the government as a nation should not be celebrating a particular religion, what I am wondering is why not. To all the secular liberals, what I fail to understand is that the idea of secularism of the founding fathers was not to be neutral but to celebrate all of them equally. Stopping people from celebrations rather than celebrating things together creates a greater division and does not provide exposure but creates more stereotypes and prejudice.

I might sound too idealistic or gullible, but what is your take on this ?? And let's not make this a battle ground ☮️✌️",0,2,2024-08-15,Psychological_Oven09,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1et3x1u/flexibility_in_modern_hinduism/,flexibility in modern hinduism,maybe its an unpopular opinion or something i have noticed selectively but temples are very open to celebrations of national festivals for example today on independace day i saw saree of devi in tricolour decorations around shiv temple with indian flags and elements of tri colour in sweets or prasadam i personally see it as a good sign that religion and nation can commingle to an extent that for some nation is religious but vice versa seems to be a scary proposition i came across a video a few days ago where pakistan which is formed on the very basis of islam its people think religion comes before the nation which makes me wonder a few things is it only hindus who show such nationalistic celebrations i could be wrong or simply might have not encountered such things with lets say mosques or churches does it make you feel more comforted or is it offensive some think its not okay to include gods and godesses into such things i mean how can a nation and religion mix its not just pakistan and islam but an interesting case study of us as well where people are more religious and follow catholicism it was very easy for the church to interfere and influence into policies they have sense then established the seperation of the state and matters of the church simply put even christians dont celebrate independance of america in their churches an unpopular opinion and tad bit controversial but if a religion can celebrate a nation why cant a nation celebrate a religion i dont mean lately we have started hiding behind the cloak of secularism and how india mainly the government as a nation should not be celebrating a particular religion what i am wondering is why not to all the secular liberals what i fail to understand is that the idea of secularism of the founding fathers was not to be neutral but to celebrate all of them equally stopping people from celebrations rather than celebrating things together creates a greater division and does not provide exposure but creates more stereotypes and prejudice i might sound too idealistic or gullible but what is your take on this and lets not make this a battle ground,flexibility modern hinduism,maybe unpopular opinion something noticed selectively temples open celebrations national festivals example today independace day saw saree devi tricolour decorations around shiv temple indian flags elements tri colour sweets prasadam personally see good sign religion nation commingle extent nation religious vice versa seems scary proposition came across video days ago pakistan formed basis islam people think religion comes nation makes wonder things hindus show nationalistic celebrations could wrong simply might encountered things lets say mosques churches make feel comforted offensive think okay include gods godesses things mean nation religion mix pakistan islam interesting case study us well people religious follow catholicism easy church interfere influence policies sense established seperation state matters church simply put even christians dont celebrate independance america churches unpopular opinion tad bit controversial religion celebrate nation cant nation celebrate religion dont mean lately started hiding behind cloak secularism india mainly government nation celebrating particular religion wondering secular liberals fail understand idea secularism founding fathers neutral celebrate equally stopping people celebrations rather celebrating things together creates greater division provide exposure creates stereotypes prejudice might sound idealistic gullible take lets make battle ground,False,-0.41203123331069946,Neutral,Real Text

# tl;dr

The latest Economic Survey attempts to encapsulate the state of the Indian economy over the past year, but for the most part echoes the praise for DPIs and techno-solutionism that has become commonplace for Indian leaders and government departments to push for in recent years. In this post, we look at what the survey has to say about DPIs generally, India’s AI mission, AgriStack and tech in agriculture, and lastly, IFF’s top contender for most opaque and lawless policy initiative, the APAAR ID.

# Background 

Annual economic surveys summarise key policy interventions and economic growth of the country for the past year. The [~2023-24 Economic Survey~](https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/doc/echapter.pdf?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) (“**survey**”), sprawling over 500 pages, is a similar attempt but also predominantly [~highlights~](https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/economic-survey-dpi-brings-down-kyc-costs-to-rs-6-from-about-rs-1-000-124072201118_1.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) India’s move towards a fintech nation and an increased adoption of technology in the financial sector. This post will break down and analyse the survey from a digital rights perspective, covering what the survey had to say about DPIs, AI, technology in the welfare sector, digital inclusion, APAAR ID, and some miscellaneous themes.

# How the survey views key digital rights issues

# On digital public infrastructure

The survey points to an increasing reliance on digital public infrastructure (“**DPI**”) and identifies it as a stepping stone for India’s economic growth. It states that Aadhaar has “drastically reduced” operational costs for user authentication and the likes of e-KYC, Aadhaar-enabled Payment System, UPI, Bharat QR, DigiLocker, e-sign, Account Aggregator, Open Network for Digital Commerce can be leveraged by players to “ensure optimum outcomes”. The survey notes that adoption of DPIs has “*brought transparency, scale operation and timely delivery of financial services to the public.*” 

A fundamental issue with DPI, which we explored at length in our [~submissions~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h9-FBmAOGhsRgZwg733lfDIpAggAczQm/view?usp=drive_link&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to the UNDP Working Group on DPI Safeguards, is the lack of transparency and accountability in its governance frameworks and operations. DPI, the way India interprets it, is built on public-private partnerships or provisioning models, and is deployed in the public sector to reach a maximum possible population cover. By keeping private partners, government instrumentalities can evade accountability and transparency requirements that do not similarly extend to the private sector. By keeping government partners, private entities may be able to benefit from exemptions reserved for government instrumentalities under various Indian laws, such as certain provisions of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“**DPDPA**”). 

For instance, Digi Yatra has been operationalised through a private company created for this purpose, Digi Yatra Foundation. Despite it being a government-backed initiative and identified as a DPI, citizens do not have comprehensive channels to seek grievance redress, nor can they seek transparency on the system under the Right to Information Act, 2005 as the Foundation is a private entity. Read more about our concerns with the governance framework [~here~](https://internetfreedom.in/tag/digiyatra/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in). Given the scale of the project and the sensitive nature of data DPI projects collect from Indian citizens, such non-transparency and poor governance framework is a glaring cause for concern and a [~tangible risk~](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/the-business-of-government?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) which has not been addressed in the survey.

There is no anchoring law, policy, or act of Parliament governing such vast public systems or providing baseline safeguards—like grievance redress mechanisms—for most DPIs operational in India today. There is little publicly available critical and human rights analysis on the infrastructure, and the success or efficacy of such mixed models in provisioning state functions is yet to be convincingly demonstrated in the Indian academic space. This [~gap in knowledge~](https://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/why-ppp-projects-fail-118042000018_1.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), juxtaposed with a strong push and rapid deployment of the mixed systems in India, is worrisome and needs to be assessed in detail.

# On the IndiaAI mission

The survey outlines several government initiatives on artificial intelligence (“**AI**”)—Future Skills Prime, YUVAi, and Responsible AI for Youth 2022—all comprising the IndiaAI Mission, for which a budget of ₹10,300 crore has been provided this year. Despite a sizable budget allotment, the survey is interestingly right in pointing out the adverse effects of thrusting AI solutions in a society. 

First, the survey heavily refers to AI as “an energy guzzler”, stating that even as developed nations favour carbon tax regimes to fight climate change, their adoption and reliance on AI is “*ramping up energy demand like never before*.” The survey painstakingly explains how damaging AI can prove to be for the climate, calling it an ‘ultimate irony’ how as “*developed nations obsess over prospective emissions from the developing world, the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence is going to result in the demand for power to expand to levels not seen in decades*.” Calling AI a “warped priority” of advanced economies, it states that AI adoption can come at the cost of economic growth for developing nations. Even AI data centres, the survey notes, are ramping up energy demand. But most amusingly—it offers this critical analysis without applying it to the Indian scenario. India is ramping up its [~AI mission~](https://indiaai.gov.in/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)—setting up data centres (centres of excellence), integrating AI in governance and welfare mechanisms, and incentivising public and private players to participate. India’s drive to emerge as a global leader in AI is carefully [~orchestrated~](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2030512&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) and widely [~documented~](https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/cabinet-approves-ambitious-indiaai-mission-to-strengthen-the-ai-innovation-ecosystem/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in). Yet, not much criticism can be seen about adverse effects of AI on a rapidly deteriorating climate. The survey also calls accelerated AI adoption “*the biggest disruption for the future of work*” and notes that India would “*not remain immune to this transformation*.” The ultimate irony, indeed!

# Digitalising agriculture

The survey places heavy focus on DPI integration and technology use in the agricultural sector. The ‘Digital Agriculture Mission 2021–2025’ aims to modernise agriculture through advanced technologies like AI, remote sensing, drones, etc. Further, per the Budget Announcement for 2023-24, the DPI plan spans information services for crop planning and health, improved access to farm inputs, credit, and insurance, help for crop estimation, market intelligence, and support for growth of agri-tech industry and start-ups. ‘

AgriStack is a prominent DPI with three foundational registries (databases): Farmers’ Registry/Database, Geo-referenced village maps and the Crop Sown Registry/ Database, along with several Support Registries/Databases (read our AgriStack primer [~here~](https://internetfreedom.in/joint-letter-to-the-agriculture-minister/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)). The 3 foundational Registries and DPI interventions in agriculture also encompasses data collection, including but not limited to personal details, profile of land held, production details, and financial details. All through this digitalisation attempt, farmers have been left out of the policymaking process. When news emerged about the Agristack, farmers were not consulted. The composition of the Task Force for the development of the DPIs also reflect the lack of farmer representation. Read our joint statement on the matter [~here~](https://internetfreedom.in/joint-letter-to-the-agriculture-minister/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in). 

A [~number of issues~](https://internetfreedom.in/privacy-of-the-people-agristack-and-farmer-issues/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) have continued to plague this domain. At the outset, consultation papers for policy implementation, if any, have been in English and full of jargon. Interventions like these [~require~](https://internetfreedom.in/iff-response-to-the-idea-paper-on-agristack/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) long term study and constant engagement through vernacular modes and implementation frameworks to assist better understanding emerging from farmers groups across the country. Farms generate a huge amount of data in their daily operations, and so are fertile ground for [~exploitation~](https://theconversation.com/farms-create-lots-of-data-but-farmers-dont-control-where-it-ends-up-and-who-can-use-it-115228?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) by agritech and fintech firms. There is notable lack of farmer consent in the system, especially one that heavily relies on data and platformisation of routine agricultural processes. Despite the fact that the DPDPA mandates consent in processing personal data, farmers have not been informed or even involved in the conversation so far. MoUs signed by the Ministry of Agriculture with giant tech platforms and companies [~without due transparency~](https://internetfreedom.in/algorithms-in-mous-and-data-for-profit-4-new-mous-signed-between-the-ministry-of-agriculture-and-private-corporations-including-jio-and-cisco/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) exacerbate these concerns. The list of concerns with tech interventions in agriculture is currently long, but the survey does not address any. As the industry and ministry stakeholders continue to push for the AgriStack and other DPIs in agriculture, we worry that farmer welfare, data privacy, and autonomy, will be increasingly undermined. Read IFF’s [~analyses of AgriStack~](https://internetfreedom.in/tag/agristack/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) for more.

# On APAAR ID

The survey calls the National Credit Framework (“**NCrF**”), announced under National Education Policy 2020 “*the bulwark of the regulatory architecture underpinning life-long learning*.” Hailed as a prime DPI, the Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (“**APAAR**”) ID is a part of NCrF being said to “bolster the regulatory architecture”. APAAR aims to issue unique IDs to students based on their Aadhaar number. An APAAR ID is a life-long longitudinal record of a student’s educational scores, achievements and related statistics, and is deemed voluntary. The survey states that with the data consent layer built into these DPIs, students can leverage this architecture for employment gains. However, there are a few flaws with this argument.

First off, we wonder how APAAR will “bolster the regulatory architecture” when it itself is [~not tethered~](https://internetfreedom.in/student-id-zero-law-or-policy/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to a law, policy or implementation document. In our attempts to find the policy implementation plan, we filed an [~RTI request~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QGwHZbxb9A7tO_-s2i6zwOC7cNPgfzua/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) with the Ministry of Education seeking a specific document titled “Schooling: Access and Quality”  which had supposedly been presented by the Minister of Education at the National Conference of Chief Secretaries held in New Delhi on December 28-29, 2023. This simple RTI has been [~transferred 26 times~](https://internetfreedom.in/quarterly-transparency-report-2024-q2/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) (!!!) between various departments within the Ministry in the past four months since it was filed. Just one document….

Additionally, contrary to what the survey believes, the APAAR framework is not adequately rooted in consent. As a scheme that is ‘voluntary’ on paper, it seems to be following in the footsteps of its grandparent, the mysterious Aadhaar, in actually being ‘mandatory’ in practice. To start with, the Ministry of Education had [~urged~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FjzfW8kzGpSficDtdlIdWNil0FckpAQg/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) states to tell schools that they must adopt the APAAR framework and suggested they hold “special PTMs” to get parents to sign off to this. So, APAAR ID is voluntary on paper but pretty mandatory for schools to follow. Then, [~educationists believe~](https://www.freepressjournal.in/education/apaar-id-unique-student-identification-raises-concerns-about-data-safety?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) that, much like Aadhaar verification, schools will be forced to ensure the participation of all stude

nts and parents. [~Teachers also think~](https://thewire.in/education/maharashtra-directs-schools-to-get-parental-consent-for-student-unique-ids?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) APAAR will eventually be thrust on them as an administrative overhead. 

Even if it becomes mandatory for schools, APAAR is, again at least on paper, optional for students (and parents, whose consent is paramount to enrol them). Consent being taken from parents does not seem to be free or informed, but rather a mere formality. Some parents have [~pointed out~](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/parents-concerned-as-apaar-id-consent-form-requires-students-personal-information-101697656934269.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) that there is no option to deny consent on the Aadhaar consent form handed to them as part of the APAAR enrollment. To make matters worse, this is also harshly juxtaposed by the reality that millions of rural, nomadic, destitute, or marginalised students do not have access to education or are [~thrown out of schools~](https://www.deccanherald.com/india/children-without-aadhaar-shut-out-of-school-1131133.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) for not possessing an Aadhaar card. By making rural schools implement an Aadhaar-based student ID, there is a risk of vast exclusion. At present, much like its foundational Aadhaar, the APAAR framework holds a \*voluntary on paper, mandatory in practice\* status which will only get more pervasive in the coming years as the Ministry [~guns for~](https://www.livemint.com/education/news/what-is-apaar-id-how-is-it-different-from-aadhaar-11705255162936.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) 100% implementation by 2026-27. Read about our ongoing efforts to gather comprehensive information about the APAAR ID [~here~](https://internetfreedom.in/student-id-zero-law-or-policy/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in). 

Under such circumstances, the survey’s tall claims and praise for APAAR ID seems hollow and incomplete without a deep impact analysis of how (terribly) it is actually panning out to be.

private partners government instrumentalities can evade accountability and transparency requirements that do not similarly extend to the private sector by keeping government partners private entities

carbon tax regimes to fight climate change their adoption and reliance on ai is ramping up energy demand like never before the survey painstakingly explains how damaging ai can prove to be for the climate calling it an ultimate irony how as developed nations obsess over prospective emissions from the developing world the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence is going to result in the demand for power to expand to levels not seen in decades calling ai a warped priority of advanced economies it states that ai adoption can come at the cost of economic growth for developing nations even ai data centres the survey notes are ramping up energy demand but most amusinglyit offers this critical analysis without applying it to the indian scenario india is ramping up its ai mission up data centres centres of excellence integrating ai in governance and welfare mechanisms and incentivising public and private players to participate indias drive to emerge as a global leader in ai is carefully orchestrated and widely documented yet not much criticism can be seen about adverse effects of ai on a rapidly deteriorating climate the survey also calls accelerated ai adoption the biggest

informed or even involved in the conversation so far mous signed by the ministry of agriculture with giant tech platforms and companies without due transparency exacerbate these concerns the list of

india,year,2024 Budget & Digital Rights: Data Protection Board & IndiaAI Mission get fresh allocation; funds for long-established schemes see reductions | Internet Freedom Foundation,"https://preview.redd.it/kmbirrr7hled1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a597e0357b77b646f52be192717d42b43559ddf

# tl;dr

The Union Budget for 2024-2025 reveals an overall increase in funds allocation for MeitY, MHA, MIB, and DoT as compared to 2023-2024. The Budget allocated to MeitY has witnessed the highest increase among these ministries – 32.56% over last year's – yet-to-be-formed Data Protection Board and the IndiaAI Mission gets funding for the first time however, rural digital literacy scheme PMGDISHA gets no funding (for the second year in a row). Although DoT cut funding for USOF by \~80% as compared to 2023-2024 Budget, it increased funding for BharatNet by 70%. While the overall increase in budgetary allocations compared to last year may paint a positive picture, on deeper analysis we realise that the decline in fund allocation towards long-established schemes and projects as well as underutilisation of funds continue to be unaddressed issues and thus a cause of contention.

# Introduction

In the final session of the 17th LS term, Union Finance Minister, Shrimati Nirmala Sitharaman, presented the Union Interim Budget for the Financial Year (“**FY**”) 2024-2025. In the ongoing Monsoon Session, the Union Finance Minister placed a new Budget for the FY2024-2024 in both houses on July 23, 2024. The Budgeted Estimates (“**BE**”) for the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (“**MeitY**”), Ministry of Home Affairs (“**MHA**”), Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (“**MIB**”), and Department of Telecommunications (“**DoT**”) witnessed an overall increase of 15.98% in the 2024-25 Union Budget compared to 2023-2024 BE. 

The budget allocated to MeitY has witnessed the highest increase (32.56%) among these Ministries in comparison to the previous Budget (2023-2024) and DoT witnessed the second highest (14.7%). The Budget for MHA and MIB got a 9.44% and 7.45% increase respectively. The increase in the BE for this fiscal year from the Revised Estimates (“**RE**”) of the previous year was also the highest for MeitY (52.11%). While DoT and MHA saw an increase of 13.79% and 9.44% respectively, MIB witnessed a decrease of 2.41% since the RE of 2023-2024.

Table 1: Total Expenditure for MeitY, MIB, DoT, and MHA (In Rs. Crores)

Digital Public Infrastructure (“**DPI**”) was an area of focus for the government during the presentation of the Union Budget including the varying schemes aimed at farmers with the digital crop survey, agri-stack, and also the service sector with a proposal for the development of more DPI apps for businesses. However, it appears that DPI(s) found limited specific budgetary allocation even after being a point of focus in the Economic Survey released a day before the Budget 2024-25. DPIs have been attributed for the rise in technological engagement of Indian citizens with more Ministries introducing population-scale interactive technological platforms which are being clubbed under the common banner of DPI. We will soon release a detailed analysis of the Economic Survey 2023-2024 and the over-reliance on technology-centred tools such as AI and DPI within it.

# The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology

The total budgetary allocation for MeitY in the Budget for 2024-2025 is ₹21936.9 Cr, which is a 32.57% increase from the previous financial year’s Budget (BE 2023-2024). The increase is even higher when compared to the RE of 2023-2024, i.e., a year-on-year change of 52.11%. This is in contrast to the budgetary trends we witnessed in 2021, 2022 and 2023, where there was underutilisation of the budget. We appreciate the large overall increase in budgetary allocation to MeitY in FY 2024-2025 and hope to see these funds be directed towards infrastructure development aimed at increasing telecom and broadband connectivity, research and deep deliberation into emerging technologies, strengthening of citizen-centric fora and systems, and closing the digital divide.

Table 2: Budgetary allocations for specific items for MeitY

The most notable change in the Budget for 2024-2025, which has direct implications for digital rights, has to be the allocation of ₹2 Cr for the Data Protection Board (“**DPB**”). After a long and arduous journey for data protection legislation, it is disappointing to see funding of a mere ₹2 Cr for a regulatory body whose functioning will have a direct impact on the implementation of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (“**DPDPA**”), 2023, successful or otherwise. Of this ₹2 crore, only ₹4 lahks is [\~reportedly\~](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-budget-2024-25-health-ministry-allocated-rs-90-958-crore-full-details-101721738915694.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) allocated for capital expenditure, which includes fixed assets such as the digital portal, and the rest (₹ 1.96 Cr) is allocated for revenue expenditure (salaries, etc). Since it is unclear when the DPB will become functional, it is difficult to ascertain whether the allocated budget is meant to  be utilised for the entire financial year or a part of it. Either way, a minuscule amount of ₹4 lakhs for capital expenditure on DPB may prove to be insufficient for upskilling and training of the DPB members. In the following Budgets, we hope MeitY ensures that it is adequately resourced for the institutional preparation of the DPB. Adequate funding for key regulatory bodies such as the DPB will contribute to its independent functioning which is necessary to keep checks and balances on the executive. 

Allocation towards a prominent regulatory body essential for the cybersecurity health of the country, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (“**CERT-In**”) also increased by 5.78% from the previous year’s Budget. On another positive note, funding allocated to ‘Cyber Security Projects’ has seen a massive increase of 89.75% since last year. This substantial increase in allocation was much needed in the backdrop of increasing incidents of data breaches and vulnerabilities and the absence of an operational, robust, and rights-advancing data protection legislation. [\~Recent\~](https://internetfreedom.in/cybersecurity-report-for-q2-2024/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) grave cybersecurity incidents, like the Tamil Nadu Police Facial Recognition Portal breach and the Telangana Police Network data leak, have raised concerns about the detection and response capabilities of India’s cybersecurity authorities. It is worth noting that MeitY utilised only ₹30.11 Cr out of the allocated ₹300 Cr in 2022-2023, despite persisting challenges of insufficient resources, outdated infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled professionals. We hope that the same trend of under-utilisation is not followed by the Ministry this fiscal year and ahead.

Another introduction this year was the addition of ‘IndiaAI Mission’ as a Central Sector Scheme, with a notable allocation of ₹551.75 Cr. This is on top of the infusion of ₹10,371.92 Cr [\~approved\~](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2012355&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) by the previous National Democratic Alliance (“**NDA**”) cabinet in March 2024 which is to be disbursed over a period of five years to establish the scheme including its Compute Capacity program. The program [\~aims\~](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2012355&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to establish a 10,000 Graphics Processing Unit infrastructure to be built with public-private partnerships. The working group appointed by the government on IndiaAI in its October 2023 [\~report\~](https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/IndiaAI-Expert-Group-Report-First-Edition.pdf?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) had recommended at least 24,500 Graphics Processing Units for infrastructural requirements. Moreover, the increased focus on AI and massive budgetary allowances form cause for concern owing to the massive effects of the technology on the climate – with a single ChatGPT search taking 10 times as much energy as a regular Google search, according to the [\~Economic Survey 2023-24\~](https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/index.php?ref=static.internetfreedom.in). The Survey cautioned against Artificial Intelligence’s impact not only on climate but also on employment opportunities amidst rising automation in industries making employees redundant. With increasing trends of techno-solutionism plaguing governance in India, increased budgetary focus on bolstering AI capabilities may result in more unnecessary technological interventions – but now with AI.

Disappointingly, the Budget for 2023-2024 and the Interim Budget for 2024-2025 for MeitY did not allocate any funds to Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (“**PMGDISHA**”), breaking the trend of continuous budgetary support for the rural digital literacy scheme since its inception in 2017. PMGDISHA was key to increased connectivity, telecom penetration, and digital literacy across India. Allocations to the scheme touched an all-time low in 2022 since 2017, and then last year in the FY 2023-24 budget, no funds were allocated towards it. The last impact assessment study of PMGDISHA was carried out by the Indian Institute of Public Administration in 2020-21. The report [\~concluded\~](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1843061&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) that the scheme, as a digital literacy programme, “*plays an indispensable part in not only bridging the digital gap in the country but also transforming it into a knowledge economy and society*.” The allocations made to this scheme must increase, and more importantly exist, to ensure its effective progress and robust digital literacy in the country.

Figure 1: Budget Allocation to PMGDISHA (MeitY)

The other interesting trend is the complete discontinuation of budgetary allocation towards ‘Promotion of Digital Payments’ under MeitY’s budget for this year. Last year, we noted that the allocation to this domain plummeted to ₹1500 Cr as compared to ₹2137 Cr allocated to it in the 2022-2023 RE, reflecting a decline of 29.8%. In the RE of 2023-2024, the allocation was further reduced to ₹584 Cr and finally to 0 in the Budget for 2024-2025. It is also interesting to note that revised allocations increased sharply in 2022-2023 (₹2137 Cr), witnessing a jump of 968.5% as compared to the 2022-2023 BE which stood at ₹200 crores. Even though the allocation in 2023-2024 is higher than the 2022 BE, it stood lower than the RE.

Figure 2: Budgetary Allocation to ‘Promotion of Digital Payments’ (MeitY)

MeitY has introduced an item titled ‘Promotion of Digital Transactions (excluding Digital Payments)’ under the DIGITAL INDIA Program, for which it has allocated ₹1.5 Cr. As per MeitY, the objective of this scheme is to promote overall digitisation for the efficient delivery of citizen-centric services and empowerment of citizens. Through this newly introduced item, MeitY hopes to grow the volume of digital transactions in the country. It also believes that this expenditure may have a cascading effect on the promotion of digital payments scheme including estimating and measuring digital economy of India, suggesting a measurement framework for such estimation, and providing suitable policy recommendations for boosting the size and growth of the digital economy in India by leveraging the digital technologies. Interestingly, despite this new addition, the total expenditure towards the DIGITAL INDIA Program has reduced significantly and consistently since the BE for 2022-2023.

# The Ministry of Home Affairs

The total budgetary allocation for MHA is 9.44% higher than what was allocated in the BE for 2023-24 and 9.44% higher than the 2023-2024 revised Budget. The allocation in the budget estimates, net of receipts and recoveries, for MHA is ₹6458.24 Cr. The allocation for planned capital expenditure has marginally dipped as compared to both 2023-2024 BE (by 10.16%) and RE (by 29.39%), which is disappointing.

Table 3: Budgetary allocations for specific items for MHA

Additionally, we notice an interesting trend in allocations to the item ‘Census, Survey and Statistics/ Registrar General of India’. For the past few years, the estimated budget for surveys and census has been large, but the actual utilisation remains minuscule. The biggest dip was seen in 2022-23, where the budget allocated was ₹3676 Cr, but only ₹513.18 Cr was utilised. For BE 2024-25, the allocation remains large, but it is likely to fall into the same pattern of remaining underutilised

Figure 4: Budgetary Allocation to Census, Survey and Statistics/Registrar General of India (MHA)

On a disappointing note, MHA did not allocate any funds towards its [\~Cyber and Information Security\~](https://www.mha.gov.in/en/divisionofmha/cyber-and-information-security-cis-division?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) (“**C&IS**”) Division, which includes key schemes such as the Cybercrime Prevention against Women and Children Scheme and the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (“**I4C**”) Scheme. [\~Reportedly\~](https://theprint.in/economy/budget-2024-mha-gets-rs-2-19-lakh-crore-focus-on-training-and-research-big-boost-for-ib-cisf/2187805/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), I4C didn’t get fresh funding this year because it “*ceased to exist as a Union government scheme starting 1 July and began working as part of the MHA*”. Interestingly, other Divisions of the MHA such as the Freedom Fighters and Rehabilitation Division and the Police Division still got funding allocated to them. From a reading of the Budget, it is unclear under which item, if at all, is MHA allocating funds for cyber security and awareness efforts. Earlier this year, I4C was [\~notified\~](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/govt-designates-i4c-as-agency-of-mha-to-notify-unlawful-activities-in-cyber-world/articleshow/108501675.cms?from=mdr&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) as the official agency by MHA to notify law enforcement authorities, under the Information Technology Act, 2000, about unlawful activities in the cyberspace. Additionally, funding for a special wing of ""cyber commandos"", reportedly an MHA project meant to tackle cyber threats along with local administration, is also missing from this year’s Budget for MHA, despite [\~expectations\~](https://www.business-standard.com/budget/news/budget-special-unit-of-cyber-commandos-on-home-ministry-s-100-day-agenda-124062100754_1.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

# The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting

The total budgetary allocation for MIB in 2024-25 is ₹4342.55 Cr, which is a 7.45% decrease from the 2023-2024 Budget and a 2.41% decrease from the 2023-2024 Revised Budget. This cut comes after MIB seemingly was able to utilise a higher budget allocation last year, which seems incongruent. Interestingly, the total budgetary allocation for FY 2024-2025 is the same as the allocation under the Interim Budget for 2024-2025, a trend uncommon for several other Ministries. 

https://preview.redd.it/uumo8ingkled1.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=01047f19263b763a7e3b4810d6ed10b8db6225d6

Table 4: Budgetary allocations for specific items for MHA

MIB’s total AE since 2014-2015 has been relatively stable, as compared to the AE of MeitY, MHA, and DoT. Notably, DoT has introduced funding for the establishment of the ‘Bhartiya Bhasha Anubhag’ scheme, which is a platform meant to facilitate the translation of various languages into Hindi and vice versa. 

# The Department of Telecommunications

In 2024-25, DoT (which operates under the Ministry of Communications) has been allocated ₹111915.43 Cr, which is a 14.69% increase over the budget allocated in 2023-24 (₹97579.05 Cr) and 13.78% over the RE for 2023-24 (₹98359.41 Cr).

Table 4: Budgetary allocations for specific items for DoT

Surprisingly, the Universal Services Obligation Fund (“USOF”) took a hit in funds with only ₹2000 Cr allocated to it in the 2024-25 Budget (same as last year’s RE), an 80.77% fall from last year’s ₹10400 Cr. Telecom services providers have [\~persistently\~](https://www.business-standard.com/budget/news/budget-wish-list-telecom-industry-calls-for-junking-usof-slashing-duties-124011800938_1.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) urged the Ministry of Finance to suspend USOF till the existing corpus is exhausted, and in their Budget requests for 2024-25, pressed for an exemption from the service tax on “assignment of right to use natural resources” and the slashing of customs duty on telecom equipment to zero. Allocation to ‘Compensation to Telecom Service Providers’ saw a 102% increase in the 2024-2025 Budget (₹10100 Cr) as compared to the 2023-2024 budget (₹5000 Cr). This item is meant to provide for the “*creation and augmentation of telecom infrastructure and access to various telecom services to people in the rural and remote areas including operation and maintenance of Village Public Telephones*.”

As far as allocations for BharatNet are concerned, there has been a significant increase of 70% in BE 2024-25 (₹8500 Cr) from BE 2023-24 (₹5000 Cr). The grant goes towards the creation of telecom infrastructure required for providing broadband connectivity to all the Gram Panchayats in the country and facilitating non-discriminatory access to service providers, for provisioning of broadband services in rural areas. The sharp increase in budget is appreciated.

Total budgetary allocation for regulatory bodies such as the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (“**TRAI**”) and Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal has seen a significant dip this year (₹113 Cr) as compared to the previous year (₹238.53 Cr). The funding for TRAI has reduced by 48.68% over the past year, even though DoT utilised the entire revised amount allocated in 2022-2023 for the regulatory body, which was more than the BE for 2022-2023.

Although DoT allocated ₹50,00,000 towards ‘Artificial Intelligence and Face Recognition Powered Solution for Telecom SIM Subscriber Verification (ASTR)’ in the 2023-2024 Budget, it has not allocated any funding in the 2024-2025 Budget. Funding for the Digital Intelligence Unit Project, which is meant to investigate fraudulent activity involving telecom resources, such as Unsolicited Commercial Communication, witnessed a drastic reduction of 61.36% in the 2024-2025 Budget (₹85 Cr) as compared to the previous Budget (₹220 Cr). DoT has also allocated ₹38.76 Cr for the first time for the ‘Prevention of Spoofed Incoming International Calls System – 'CIOR' (Centralized International Out Roamer)’.

# Conclusion

The 2024-25 Budget leaves us with a variety of feelings, some of hope and some of disappointment. While there are some budgetary allocations made for the first time, like the DPB, IndiaAi Mission, and ‘Promotion of Digital Transactions’, long-established budgetary items such as the ‘Promotion of Digital Payments’, PMGDISHA, the Census, I4C, and the USOF either witnessed a complete discontinuation of funds or took a significant hit in the allocated funds. Overall funding towards the DPB includes planned capital expenditure of only ₹4 lakhs which is inadequate to say the least. An additional cause for concern is the decrease in the AE as compared to the RE, and in the RE as compared to the BE, for the last few years. The RE indicates how much is possible for the government to extend to the concerned sector and the AE indicates how much was extended. While some variation among the three is inevitable, too much of a difference can [\~reduce\~](https://www.indiaspend.com/budget/be-re-or-actuals-what-do-you-need-to-look-at-in-the-upcoming-budget-800937?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) the credibility of the numbers and cause uncertainty. Cuts in and underutilisation of the RE may also negatively affect the implementation of government schemes and projects. In light of the increasing digitisation across sectors and the increasing demand for improved digital literacy as well as access to digital services, we hope that the fund allocation in these concerned sectors continues to witness a positive trend. Although we appreciate the overall increase in BE this year as compared to last year, we hope to see these funds be utilised efficiently and directed towards infrastructure development aimed at increasing tele-connectivity, broadband connectivity, cybersecurity, and overall digital literacy.",4,0,2024-07-25,InternetFreedomIn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ebmc2w/2024_budget_digital_rights_data_protection_board/,budget digital rights data protection board indiaai

deep deliberation into emerging technologies strengthening of citizencentric fora and systems and closing the digital divide table budgetary allocations for specific items for meity the most notable change in the budget for which has direct implications for digital rights has to be the allocation of cr for the data protection board dpb after a long and arduous journey for data protection legislation it is disappointing to see funding of a mere cr for a regulatory body whose functioning will have a direct impact on the implementation of the digital personal data protection act dpdpa successful or otherwise of this crore only lahks is reportedly allocated for capital expenditure which includes fixed assets such as the digital portal and the rest cr is allocated for revenue expenditure salaries etc since it is unclear when the dpb will become functional it is difficult to ascertain whether the allocated budget is meant to be utilised for the entire financial year or a part of it either way a minuscule amount of lakhs for capital expenditure on dpb may prove to be insufficient for upskilling and training of the dpb members in the following budgets we hope meity ensures that it is adequately resourced for the institutional preparation of the dpb adequate funding for key regulatory bodies such as the dpb will contribute to its independent functioning which is necessary to keep checks and balances on the executive allocation towards a prominent regulatory body essential for the cybersecurity health of the country the indian computer emergency response team certin also increased by from the previous years budget on another positive note funding allocated to cyber security projects has seen a massive increase of since last year this substantial increase in allocation was much needed in the backdrop of increasing incidents of data breaches and vulnerabilities and the absence of an operational robust and rightsadvancing data protection legislation recent grave cybersecurity incidents like the tamil nadu police facial recognition portal breach and the telangana police network data leak have raised concerns about the detection and response capabilities of indias cybersecurity authorities it is worth noting that meity utilised only cr out of the allocated cr in despite persisting challenges of insufficient resources outdated infrastructure and a shortage of skilled professionals we hope that the same trend of underutilisation is not followed by the ministry this fiscal year and ahead another introduction this year was the addition of indiaai mission as a central sector scheme with a notable allocation of cr this is on top of the infusion of cr approved by the previous national democratic alliance nda cabinet in march which is to be disbursed over a period of five years to establish the scheme including its compute capacity program the program aims to establish a graphics processing unit infrastructure to be built with publicprivate partnerships the working group appointed by the government on indiaai in its october report had recommended at least graphics processing units for infrastructural requirements

india,year,I want to leave india.,"And when I say I want to, people start protesting ""You hate your country haww, so you are just wasting our resources?"" Bitch I pay for them

You want to know why I want to leave? You want to act like questioning the state of things makes me some kind of traitor? Fine. Let's go step by step because apparently, blind patriotism is easier than confronting reality.

Let’s start with the latest outrage—the Supreme Court telling Ranveer Allahbadia that his jokes would ""make women feel ashamed."" Oh, so now we care about women’s dignity? When it’s about a guy cracking jokes, suddenly the system wants to step in and be the moral police. But when it’s about something that actually matters—marital rape? Silence. Absolute, deafening silence. You know what’s legal here? A man forcing himself on his wife, because apparently, marriage is a free pass for assault. But sure, let’s focus on jokes. Let’s spend our time on the big issues like comedy instead of, I don’t know, the fact that rapists walk free, that women have to beg for justice, that survivors are shamed while criminals get sympathy.

And since we’re talking about priorities, let’s talk about law and order in general. Every week, a new case of some rich, powerful guy committing a crime and getting away with it. Drunk drivers mowing down people? Political connections will fix it. A celebrity gets caught doing something illegal? Don’t worry, a PR campaign will clear their image. A regular person, though? Get ready to rot in the system. There’s no justice here—just a game where the rich and connected win, and the rest of us pretend we live in a functioning democracy.

But let’s not stop there. Let’s talk about the culture—because this country prides itself on being “progressive” while clinging to ideas that should’ve died centuries ago. Ever since this Ranveer Allahbadia controversy, it’s been clearer than ever that we’re not moving forward—we’re stuck. Our definition of progress is adding more shopping malls while keeping the same regressive mindsets alive. Women still get judged for what they wear. Inter-caste or interfaith couples still get harassed. Parents still control their kids like they own them, shoving them into careers they hate because “log kya kahenge” (what will people say). And god forbid you question tradition—because the moment you do, you're suddenly disrespecting ""Bharatiya sanskriti"" (Indian culture).

Let’s move on to infrastructure, or rather, the lack of it. My parents pay their taxes, but where does that money go? Because it’s sure as hell not going into roads. I don’t even live in some remote village—I live in a developed town. But apparently, ""developed"" means nothing, because the nearest McDonald's is 17 kilometers away. And sure, it’s not about McDonald's itself—it’s about how basic infrastructure is still a joke. Potholes, traffic that moves slower than a dying snail, and an internet speed that makes you question if you’re still in 2025 or if you time-traveled back to 2008.

And then there’s education. A system that rewards memorization over intelligence. A system where creativity is crushed and students are pushed into engineering or medicine like cattle, with no regard for what they actually want. You’re not taught to think—you’re taught to obey. Schools don’t prepare you for life; they prepare you to be a replaceable cog in an overpopulated machine. And if you dare to dream outside the conventional path? Good luck explaining that to your family, because in their eyes, success is a government job or an IIT degree.

Then we have the economy. Oh, you want to build wealth? Well, good luck, because if you're not born into it, you're in for a lifelong struggle. Wages are low, the cost of living is rising, and everything is taxed to death. Want to start a business? Get ready to drown in bureaucratic nonsense and corruption. Want to invest? Hope you enjoy government policies changing overnight, killing industries with zero warning. And if you somehow manage to make money, guess what? You’re still at the mercy of outdated financial policies and a stock market that swings like a drunk pendulum.

And finally, the biggest hypocrisy of all—if I want to leave, suddenly I’m the villain? Suddenly, I “hate my country”? No. I don’t hate my country—I hate what it has become. I hate that questioning these things makes people defensive instead of introspective. I hate that people refuse to acknowledge reality because it’s easier to pretend everything is fine. I hate that I have to explain why wanting a better life isn’t a betrayal.

But sure, keep calling me ungrateful. Keep telling me that ""no country is perfect,"" as if that excuses everything. Keep pretending that patriotism means blind obedience instead of demanding better. And while you do that, I’ll be making my way to a place that values progress over empty pride.

india,year,"Let’s stop the “Reject Hindi” propaganda — North India is multilingual, not mono-lingual.","There’s a growing narrative that paints Hindi as some sort of “imposed” language, especially when referring to North India. But here's the reality: North Indians don’t just speak Hindi — they speak their regional languages and Hindi.

From Marwari, Khadiboli, Haryanvi, Awadhi, Punjabi, Bhojpuri, Magahi, Pahadi to Bundelkhandi — North India is linguistically rich and diverse. Most people are multilingual by default. Hindi often serves as a common bridge between these dialects and communities, not a replacement for them.

Every few hundred kilometers, the dialect and culture change — that's the beauty of the region. But that doesn’t mean Hindi is irrelevant or “forced.” It's just more widely understood, making it a practical lingua franca, especially in a country as diverse as India.

Ironically, some who advocate “reject Hindi” overlook the fact that Hindi speakers themselves are fluent in multiple languages — including their mother tongue. So if someone moves to a northern state, expecting everyone to abandon Hindi and speak only the local dialect isn’t just unrealistic — it’s divisive.

Also, migration patterns show that there’s far more internal migration within North India than migration to distant regions like Assam. This makes Hindi even more important for communication and coexistence across states.

Respect regional languages, absolutely. But rejecting Hindi isn’t the answer. India thrives because of its unity in diversity — not by drawing linguistic battle lines.

india,year,"So, I might have avoided a scam from the Amazon delivery guys after all! The puzzle finally makes sense!","In the past 16 hours, many have read my posts and  there have been some pieces of the puzzle that just didn't fit. 

1. Why deliver a fraud package and not mark it as delivered? 

2. Why come back with the supposedly right item, but in packaging that's clearly tampered and not the one in which Amazon ships the package?

3. Why insist I take the unmarked, tampered package? 

This scam just didn't make any sense! It's a scam, but how? What are they getting? Well, going through other posts across subs gave me the clue needed to solve the puzzle. 

Read this:

https://techenclave.com/threads/psa-beware-stolen-goods-selling-on-facebook-and-watsapp-groups.222481/

Now it makes sense! Maybe, all they needed was a bit more time, and that's why they delivered that fraud package first and buy more time to tamper with the mobile inside and repack it, or maybe this is their ruse to make the customers accept a tampered package. First delivery something else, and then bring the other package and let the customer check it. 

That's the only way it all makes sense! Why would they risk being caught otherwise? Why would they insist I open and check the package? They want me to accept it so that Amazon doesn't get to know there was a problem. 

And my risk is that if I accepted that tampered parcel, I would be in breach of their terms for delivery as I accepted a tampered parcel, complicating any problems that might happen later. 

I hope this post will make it clear for others about this potential, sophisticated scam, and seriously, read the terms and conditions that these companies provide as they seem to change too.

From Aadhar to Nuclear plants, SBI, Dominos, the Credit cards on Joker's stash, when will people wake up?  
When will laws get stricter and infra get better?

I'm from Dehradun and last week, Uttarakhand faced a massive cyber attack apparently malware / ransomware.  
I've heard of some critical gaps and human errors, but don't wanna talk about it as my account is fairly public.

I remember stumbling upon my parent's data and credit card details many years ago in one such leak, when I was 14, on a forum on Tor (Dark web), but could do nothing about it.

india,year,Has anyone used the 'Add Free Date Change' on make-my-trip for indigo for an international flight and used it successfully?,"TDLR: basically booking a flight returning back from an international city to mumbai and need to know if 'Add Free Date Change' that is exclusively offered by MMT works?

Hello all! Trying to book an indigo flight from an international city to mumbai but the flexi option offered says the rescheduling is offered upto 4 days before the flight and the fees are like more than half of the ticket price. 

Then i see an MMT feature called 'Add free date change' which allows me to pay an extra 800 INR but the T&C mentions vague lines like 'A Customer will be eligible for the Product subject to the respective airline policy regarding free date change' and 'In both the above-mentioned situations, the free date change option shall be provided by the Airline, at its sole discretion, to the Customer. The offer by MakeMyTrip shall stand void in these situations and MakeMyTrip shall not be liable or responsible to return the amount of Premium collected against the offer.' which basically could imply the after spending this 800 INR also indigo might not offer it?

india,year,Work-related technical question - Are VPN connections legally allowed or being blocked in India?,"I work at a company in the Netherlands and plan to work remotely from India (Punjab) for a few weeks. I use the company's private VPN regardless of where I have to work from.

Our HR and tax policies allow this remote working arrangement. However, the IT department published an article recently listing countries where one may not be able ~or allowed~ to use the company VPN and should check the countries' restrictions upfront. 

* North Korea
* Belarus
* Oman
* Iraq
* Turkmenistan
* China
* Russia
* Türkiye
* The United Arab Emirates (UAE): Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah
* India
* Iran
* Egypt
* Uganda

It was a bit surprising to see some of the countries on this list, and for many co-workers, the information still needs to be clarified. Including me, who understands only in a limited way how VPNs work. 

While we wait for the IT department to share more information,  good to learn from Redditors if there are any current or upcoming laws., or personal experience.  Based on a simple Google search, nothing seems problematic but I might have missed something?

Thus coming to conclusion that Modi is encouraging Hardliners to do these things.

from Huffpost US, Washington Post, NYT, CNN, Reuters, Guardian, Foreign Policy, even FT, Economist and many 100's of Global news outlets are having editorial's cautioning Modi and India. some of it is reaching Europe, China as well.

india,all,[AskIndia] Planning to return to India after 5 years in USA. Am I making a huge mistake?,"I am BE IT graduate that worked in Bangalore for 5 years before my company sent me to USA. I am working in USA since last 5 years. My parents are now asking me to return and I myself am not too opposed to the idea of returning. These are my reasons for that - 

1. I am living in a small town here with almost non-existent public transport. Since I myself don't know driving, I have to depend on Uber and sometimes my colleagues to get around. If I have to go anywhere, I have to think ten times whether it is absolutely necessary. Even if it is a doctor visit. That brings me to - 

2. I've had one or the other sickness for every single day in last 3 years. Every.Single.Day. So much so that I seriously think that I am under voodoo / black magic spell. (Yea, you stay ill for 3 years without any apparent reason and then tell me how I'm an idiot for believing in superstitions.). Something here is not suiting me. One possible reason of some of the illness might be - 

3. Frozen food for dinner. Since I don't know cooking. I mostly buy the frozen rotis, MTR curry etc in bulk (a month's worth at a time) and eat those for dinner. I have developed a paunch like a woman in second / third trimester. During my last annual physical exam, the doctor said I have slightly higher levels of protein that's nothing to worry about. When I was in Bangalore, I used to go out to the local saagar restaurants every night and eat there. Those are relatively fresher / healthier, right?

4. My H1B visa has already been renewed once and that expires in December 2016. Even if my company applies for Green card now, that will take years and I'll have to slog at this soul sucking job.

Now, here are the reasons I'm apprehensive about returning to India - 

1. Money - Income will definitely take a nose dive. In USA salary is good compared to expenses. But in India, salary will be meager compared to sky-high prices of everything. Look house rent / gadgets below.

2. Living comforts. Here in USA, any house I rent, it'll have fully furnished kitchen / bathroom / laundry. And the rent is 1/8th of my monthly take-home salary. But in India, mostly I will get a house with walls and nothing else. Kitchen - buy gas, buy stove, buy everything. Bathroom - with only cold water supply, that too won't have water half the time. + buy bucket, buy mug etc etc. Shower-head, wo kya hota hai? Laundry - what laundry? Find a laundry wala and give him exorbitant money to wash clothes. It'll be very difficult to find a furnished home with all amenities and even when I find one, rent will be sky high and it will be far from workplace.

2. Weather / Pollution - Here in Seattle **(edit - 20 mile from Seattle. Who would understand where it is if I give the unknown small town's name??)**, it is mostly cloudy or cold. it gets hot only one month in a year and that too is manageable. And when it is cold, your house is heated, office is heated, cars have AC. You don't have to tolerate / suffer the weather. The thought of braving Indian summer again is giving me fevers. Plus, air / noise pollution etc.

3. Online commerce - I can buy anything online here and don't have worry about being scammed. For the most part. I bought mattress online and got it delivered to my home, for crying out loud. That's obviously not the case in India. Most of the things can't be ordered online. Moreover, the stories of Indian e-commerce sites scamming people (brick instead of phone, bundle of newspapers instead of the item, fuckall refund policies, chutiya customer support etc) are all over the place. I hear Amazon India has started operations recently, so there's some hope.

4. Internet - Here, I am always connected and always downloading one thing or the other. Here are [TV shows I follow](http://i.imgur.com/k8yvMMS.jpg), [movies I had in my watchlist](http://i.imgur.com/SWw4eJz.jpg). Every month I download the full factory images (2+ GBs) for both my nexus phones. I download these every month without any headache of how much data I'm consuming or how much it is going to cost me; since WiFi is part of the fixed house rent. (so is electricity, so is water.). I hear Internet speed in India is now good enough (I personally didn't experience that when I was in Kolkata 3 years ago.) But all connections are limited by FUP. And the higher the cap is, the more you pay obviously. And again, that will burn a big hole in monthly savings.

5. Electronic items - I love phones / gadgets. But the latest models are almost never available in India on launch. They come to India months / year later, when it is no longer top shelf. And even then, they are so much more costlier than their US price. For example, I wouldn't think twice about buying a $500 - $600 Google ~~Nexus~~ Pixel phone here. But the same phone will be so much more costlier in India. Plus, it will be higher %age of the salary too. And I will have to buy it from some shady 3rd party retailer and won't get any warranty / support.

6. Work culture - In USA, people are professional. You do your job and everyone is happy. Your manager treats you like a person. In India, kaam gaya tel lene, you must spend 9 hours (not 8, but 9.) At your desk. Even if your task is complete, fucking be tied to your desk and do some other work. Managers act like they are the owners of the employees. All promotions are caste biased. If you want to switch jobs, you have to serve 3 month notice period (instead of 1-2 week in USA) but all new employers expect you to join in 2 weeks.

All in all, I'm fuckin confused like hell. Should I return or should I stay..!! There's also a new Full Time Employee position open at my client's office. i.e. If I join that, I'll be doing the same job, but I'll be a direct employee of the client and not a contract via vendor. Dunno whether that makes it any easy.

I'm not here to bash India or anything like that. I really need some advice here. Maybe if any of you have returned to India after staying in USA for years, you can tell me how easy / difficult it was. Or maybe you can debunk my Pros / cons list.

It's 8:30 PM here right now. I'll be online till midnight and can read / reply to comments till then. And then later in the morning.",133,275,2016-09-20,iWizardB,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/53lik1/askindia_planning_to_return_to_india_after_5/,askindia planning to return to india after

india,all,Breaking: The Telecom Bill has been passed in Lok Sabha | Our First Read of the bill,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ifpn0jqing7c1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb4380154c05823a209e737e6a3388d1358837a

[**Help us sustain the work we do**](https://internetfreedom.in/donate?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)

## tl;dr

The Telecommunications Bill, 2023 (“Telecom Bill, 2023”) was introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 18, almost a year after the conclusion of the consultation process for its 2022 counterpart, i.e. the draft Indian Telecommunication Bill, 2022 (“Telecom Bill, 2022”). After several reported inter-ministerial discussions over the year, the Department of Telecommunications (“DoT”) has released a repackaged version of the colonial 1885 law it meant to overhaul, which continues to retain the draconian surveillance and internet suspension powers of the Union government. 

## Why should you care?

Laws governing telecommunication services in the country have historically been used and misused to surveil our devices and suspend our internet. With changing times, these laws are also evolving, expanding the scope of applicability to new and emerging services. The [**Telecom Bill, 2022**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tX5sTSZEgo-9b3fVoInXFlUY93ZlFcYj/view?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) attempted to include online communication services (Signal, Zoom, Skype, Gmail) under the licensing regime historically applicable to broadcasting services. The expansion of surveillance and suspension powers from traditional broadcasting services to online communication services will cause irreparable damage to user rights and democratic freedoms.  Definitional ambiguity in the [**Telecom Bill, 2023**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U56m1jE8CsLH7GMl5DTOu3iA4TxOito8/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) leaves us worried and confused about its application to internet services. In any scenario, the bill will have implications for our fundamental right to privacy as well as our constitutional freedoms such as freedom of expression and right to receive information.

## The journey of the Telecom Bill from 2022 till 2023 

The Indian Telecom Bill, 2022 was released for public consultation on September 21, 2022,  following the release of the consultation paper on the “Need for a new legal framework governing Telecommunication in India” which was published on July 23, 2022. Interestingly, the Telecom Bill, 2022, which was released merely three weeks after the conclusion of the consultation period for the paper, inserted controversial provisions, which was not present in the latter. In a response to a Right to Information (“RTI”) filed by us, the DoT [**shared**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cRUKSbOO0lzpy6ohWTKhBzCl-ezSG40H/view?usp=share_link&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) all responses it received on the consultation paper \[Read our comments on the paper [**here**](https://static.internetfreedom.in/comments-on-the-consultation-paper-on-the/)\]. The DoT however [**refused**](https://internetfreedom.in/https-internetfreedom-in-digital-transparency-report-for-january-2023/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to share the comments it received on the Telecom Bill, 2022, which were invited till late last year \[Read our comments on the paper [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/our-response-to-the-draft-telecom-bill-2022/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)\]. The absence of such disclosures make the reasoning/inspiration behind the changes non-transparent. 

## Key concerns

### Repackaged control, replicated language

The ‘statement of objects and reasons’ under the Telecom Bill, 2023 acknowledges the need to create a *“legal and regulatory framework that focuses on safe and secure telecommunication network that provides for digitally inclusive growth*”. According to the Telecom Bill, 2022, the aim of introducing such a bill was to ​​create a modern and future-ready comprehensive framework for the telecommunication sector in India which is currently governed by several colonial laws. While we agree with the need to reform the laws governing the sector, we dispute the approach adopted by the DoT to do so. Key provisions relating to surveillance and internet suspension, which have a long lasting, profound impact on our digital rights, have been replicated verbatim from the Telegraph Act of 1885. It will be unfair to say that the bill has not undergone changes in phrasing, but it will also be unfair to equate this change with reform. A contested provision of the Telecom Bill, 2022, i.e. licensing, has been replaced, only in name, by a concept of “authorisation”. The fundamental function of issuing authorisation is still an exclusive right of the Union government. Reliance on “public safety” and “national security” grounds to empower the Union government with powers to temporarily possess, suspend, intercept, detain any telecommunication service or telecommunication network from an authorised entity is nothing more than an old trick of the 1885 playbook.

### Ambiguity around fundamental concepts of scope

Much backlash received by the DoT during the public consultation on the Telecom Bill, 2022 was around the wide definition of ‘telecommunication services’ which explicitly included a long list of online communication services. The definition of ‘telecommunication’ \[Clause 2(p)\] read with ‘telecommunication services’ \[Clause 2(t)\] is now heavily diluted and truncated, creating uncertainty about the scope of applicability to internet services. Without this clarity, it creates hindrances in foreseeing the impact on user rights and thus meaningfully responding to or analysing the bill. Such definitional ambiguity, whether or not intentional, leaves the scope wide enough for online communication services to be included within its ambit. If internet services are included in the law’s ambit, then the several alarming requirements related to surveillance, possession, suspension, authorisation, etc. will be applied to those services as well, deepening the threats to our rights and freedoms. To avoid expansion or re-interpretation of the scope in the future, the definition of telecommunication and telecommunication services, in the bill itself, must explicitly exclude internet services.

&#x200B;

### Threats to user privacy and rights

The Telecom Bill, 2023 deteriorates user rights in several other ways, many of which directly infringe on the user’s fundamental right to privacy. Clause 3(7) is one such privacy invading provision which imposes an obligation on any authorised entity, as notified by the Union govt, to identify the person to whom it provides telecom services, through use of any verifiable biometric based identification “as may be prescribed”. The Telegraph Act, 1885 also contained a similar provision for licensed entities, but with safeguards and specificity. Section 4(3)(a) listed the various modes of authentication that may be used by the licensee, including offline authentication, and also explicitly mentioned alternatives authentication modes to Aadhaar such as passport. The “biometric” based identification mode did not even feature in the Telecom Bill, 2022. This inclusion of “verifiable biometric based identification” raises fears that it may provide a legislative basis for the mandatory linking of Aadhaar to mobile phones which was ruled as [**unconstitutional**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aadhaar-verdict-supreme-court-judgment-uidai-5374829/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) by the Supreme Court of India. Thus, this provision is bereft of safeguards on many levels, but is most prominently inadequate for pushing technology solutions for a country which is still largely not digital literate. In the absence of informed understanding of how such biometric data will be used, stored, processed, and shared among majority of the public, and in the presence of a non-robust data protection act which provides wise ranging exemptions to the government, such technology should not be adopted for a routine procedure, especially in the absence of offline alternative.

Another potentially privacy infringing provision is Clause 29 of the Telecom Bill, 2023 which imposes a duty on users to not furnish any false information while establishing their identity for availing ‘telecommunication services’. If applicable to internet services, the ambiguous phrasing of Clause 3(7) and 29 will have damaging consequences for a user’s ability to stay anonymous while communicating. This can have a deleterious impact on vulnerable individuals such as whistleblowers and journalists, who wish to keep their identity anonymous. Services such as Twitter and Instagram, which currently provide users with the option to communicate anonymously, will possibly have to take back this facility if they wish to operate in India. The application of this clause in the context of traditional telecommunication services can be viewed from the perspective of rising cybercrime in the country. Notably, the associated penalty for failing to comply with these provisions are, i.e. up to INR 25,000 for the first offence and for the second or subsequent offences, up to INR 50,000 for every day till the contravention continues. The imposition of such hefty fines must be avoided for such clauses given the low digital literacy rates in the country as well as to avoid the misuse of the associated penalty by authorities, to coerce users into mandatorily using Aadhaar.   

### Centralised executive control and powers

The ability to suspend, curtail, or revoke the authorisation or assignment in case of breach of any of its terms and conditions rests with the Union government \[Clause 32(2)\]. A similar provision to revoke the licence exists in the Telegraph Act, 1885, but it does not have any provisions for suspension of the licence. The entirety of Clause 20 in the Telecom Bill, 2023, whether it is the Union government’s power to temporarily possess, suspend, intercept, detain any telecommunication service \[20(1)(a)\], to intercept, detain, disclose, or suspend any message or class of messages \[20(2)(a)\], to direct suspension of any telecommunication service or class of telecommunication \[20(2)(b)\], or to notify encryption and data processing standards \[19(f)\], cements the colonial powers of the Union government, which upon misused and if extended to internet services, may become nothing less than draconian.

Clause 22(3) read with 2(f) empowers the Union government to notify ‘critical telecommunication infrastructure’ and issue measures related to the protection of such telecommunication networks and services. Protection measures listed include collection, analysis, and dissemination of traffic data, wherein ‘traffic data’ is defined as any data generated, transmitted, received or stored in telecommunication networks including data relating to the type, routing, duration or time of a telecommunication. This special categorisation and the Union government’s power to notify them, provide rules for their standards, and give them directions did not exist in the Telegraph Act, 1885. Thus, in addition to retaining several provisions that centralised power and control with the Executive, the Telecom Bill, 2023 has created new ones that does so. 

Clause 43 is reflective of this effort as it confers quasi-judicial powers to any officer authorised by the Union government to “*search any building, vehicle, vessel, aircraft or place in which he has reason to believe that any unauthorised telecommunication network…. in respect of which an offence punishable under section 42 has been committed, is kept or concealed and take possession thereof.*” Such search and seizure powers are accompanied with the power to summon information, documents, or records in possession or control of any authorised entity if it is believed by the Union government to be necessary for any pending or apprehended civil or criminal proceedings \[Clause 44\]. Such powers, non-existent in the Telegraph Act, 1885, may be open to misuse due to its ambiguous phrasing, absence of clear parameters of information that may be revealed, and overbroad grounds for revealing information due to the use of the phrase “apprehended”. This vagueness may lead to overbroad requests for disclosure which could result in the violation of the right to privacy of users, especially if it is applicable to internet services.

### Missed opportunity for surveillance and suspension reform 

There is replication of language from the Telegraph Act, 1885 \[Section 5(2)\] to the Telecom Bill, 2023 \[Clause 20(2)(a)\], maintaining surveillance powers without any meaningful oversight or accountability processes. This centralises power in the Union and State Executive and is contrary to Supreme Court judgements and advances in surveillance regulations in comparative, common law jurisdictions (see [**here**](https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2013/12/18/surveillance-and-privacy-in-india-iv-analysing-the-landmark-pucl-judgment/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [**here**](https://privacylibrary.ccgnlud.org/case/justice-ks-puttaswamy-ors-vs-union-of-india-ors?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), and [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/surveillance-reform-pdpb/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)). Through Clause 20(2)(b), the Telecom Bill, 2023 cements the internet suspension power with the DoT without putting in place any of the procedural safeguards directed by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin vs Union of India (2020) \[3 SCC 637\]* and the Standing Committee on Information Technology in its [**report**](https://internetfreedom.in/concerned-with-frequent-internet-suspensions-parliamentary-committee-recommends-an-overhaul/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in). It also misses an opportunity to fix the shortcomings of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) [**Rules**](https://dot.gov.in/circulars/temporary-suspension-telecom-services-public-emergency-or-public-safety-rules-2017?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), 2017. If the Telecom Bill, 2023 becomes applicable to online communication services, service providers such as Whatsapp, Signal etc., which adopt the privacy protecting practice of End-to-End encryption (“E2EE”), may also be required to intercept, detain, disclose, or suspend any message, wherein ""message"" is defined as “*any sign, signal, writing, text, image, sound, video, data stream, intelligence or information sent through telecommunication*” \[Clause 2(g)\]. The Telecom Bill, 2023 has failed to introduce improvements in the surveillance and internet shutdown architecture of the country on the basis of privacy, transparency, and accountability.

### Users in the eye of the storm

The penalty imposed on users for using unauthorised telecommunication services, either knowingly or having reason to believe it to be unauthorised, has been increased from INR 50 in the Telegraph Act, 1885 and INR 1 Lakh in the Telecom Bill, 2022 to a hefty 10 Lakh in the Telecom Bill, 2023 \[Third Schedule\]. The ground “having reason to believe so” may be misused and may put the user at a disadvantage as it appears to place the burden on them to prove lack of knowledge about the authorisation status of any service.

### Troubling patterns of delegated legislation 

Much like several of the legislations and draft bills released in the recent past, the Telecom Bill, 2023 suffers from excessive delegation by according the Union government overbroad rule-making powers without introducing adequate safeguards. While some instances of delegated legislation are justifiable, even necessary, at several instances out of the total 46 instances, specificity in the Bill is left to future rulemaking. Leaving relevant clarifications open to details that “may be prescribed” or “notified” in certain instances such as providing exemption from and terms and conditions for authorisation, specifying duration, and manner of interception, disclosure, and suspension of telecommunication services, etc. contribute to increased uncertainty, vagueness, and raise concerns around arbitrary rule-making.

Some improvements do exist in the Telecom Bill, 2023. For instance, an attempt to dilute TRAI’s powers with respect to the governance of this sector introduced in the Telecom Bill, 2022 has been reviewed and improved on in the 2023 bill. The controversial provision in the 2022 version allowing the identity of the sender of a message using telecommunication services to be made available to the user receiving such message, in such form as may be prescribed, has been removed in  the Telecom Bill, 2023.

## #KillTheBill

The Telecom Bill, 2023, like its 2022 counterpart, has retained its [**colonial roots**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-draft-indian-telecommunication-bill/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) and missed an opportune moment for bringing about reform. The DoT must thus publicly release the comments received by it during the consultation on the Telecom Bill, 2022 in the interest of transparency and accountability, so the stakeholders can gain insight into the DoT’s reasoning for holding on to provisions of an archaic law. Secondly, we urge the DoT to withdraw the Telecom Bill, 2023, and replace it with a right-centric version that protects and promotes individual rights. This version must be accompanied with a white paper/ explanatory note with justifications and reasoning for introducing any changes introduced in comparison with the Telecom Bill of 2022 as well as 2023. The DoT must also hold another consultation, that is broad, multi-city, in-person stakeholder. 

The Telecom Bill, 2023 is slated for passage in the Lok Sabha today, i.e. December 20. In the absence of the crucial voice of the suspended 140+ opposition Members of Parliament and in light of the current state of chaos, disarray, protest, and walk outs in the Parliament, the Telecom Bill, 2023 must not be passed. We also recommend the Union Government to appoint a Law Commission and/or an unbiased, independent Standing Committee or expert body to look into the kinds of reforms needed for the telecommunication sector. Finally, the clarification about online communication services being excluded from the scope of the bill must be explicitly and clearly added in the text of the bill itself, and not be inserted in subsequent, not enforceable FAQs (frequently asked questions) or clarified through verbal statements by the [**Union Minister**](https://www.exchange4media.com/amp/digital-news/ott-excluded-from-telecom-services-purview-in-new-draft-of-telecom-bill-2023-131514.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), or unnamed ‘[**senior officials**](https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/policy/no-decision-yet-on-having-similar-rules-for-otts-and-telcos-official/106138191?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)’.

almost a year after the conclusion of the consultation process for its counterpart ie the draft indian telecommunication bill telecom bill after several reported interministerial discussions over the

powers of the union government why should you care laws governing telecommunication services in the country have historically been used and misused to surveil our devices and suspend our internet with changing times these laws are also evolving expanding the scope of applicability to new and emerging services the telecom bill attempted to include online communication services signal zoom skype

services will cause irreparable damage to user rights and democratic freedoms definitional ambiguity in the telecom bill leaves us worried and confused about its application to internet services in any scenario the bill will have implications for our fundamental right to privacy as well as our constitutional freedoms such as freedom of expression and right to receive information the journey of the telecom bill from till the indian telecom bill was released for public consultation on september following the release of the consultation paper on the need for a new legal framework governing telecommunication in india which was published on july interestingly the telecom bill which was released merely three weeks after the conclusion of the consultation period for the paper inserted

the need to create a legal and regulatory framework that focuses on safe and secure telecommunication network that provides for digitally inclusive growth according to the telecom bill the aim of introducing such a bill was to create a modern and futureready comprehensive framework for the telecommunication sector in india which is currently governed by several colonial laws while we agree with the need to reform the laws governing the sector we dispute the approach adopted by the dot to do so key provisions relating to surveillance and internet suspension which have a long lasting profound impact on our digital rights have been replicated verbatim from the telegraph act of it will be unfair to say that the bill has not undergone changes in phrasing but it will also be unfair to equate this change with reform a contested provision of the telecom bill ie licensing has been replaced only in name by a concept of authorisation the fundamental function of issuing authorisation is still an exclusive right of the union government reliance on public safety and national security grounds to empower the union government with powers to temporarily possess suspend intercept detain any telecommunication service or telecommunication network from an authorised entity is nothing more than an old trick of the playbook ambiguity around fundamental concepts of scope much backlash received by the dot during the public consultation on the telecom bill was around the wide definition of telecommunication services which explicitly included a long list of online communication services the definition of telecommunication clause p read with telecommunication services clause t is now heavily diluted and truncated creating uncertainty about the scope of applicability to internet services without this clarity it creates hindrances in foreseeing the impact on user rights and thus meaningfully responding to or analysing the bill such definitional ambiguity whether or not intentional leaves the scope wide enough for online communication services to be included within its ambit if internet services are included in the laws ambit then the several alarming requirements related to surveillance possession suspension authorisation etc will be applied to those services as well deepening the threats to our rights and freedoms to avoid expansion or reinterpretation of the scope in

india,all,How or when will our passports get stronger,"My blood is boiling when I read about the documents required for international travel while comparing it with the requirements of other countries. There’s so many unnecessary, illogical rules that makes travel extremely difficult and much more expensive than “privileged” countries. 

I have a flight from the UK to Delhi and I have a layover in Frankfurt and apparently I need to get a visa just for a fucking airport transit. And that cost me around ₹8000 need to wait for 15 days and need to submit another set of documents. It’s extremely dehumanising and embarrassing for us being treated like this. Why is our passport not stronger and how does one’s passport get stronger ?

Edit : as the post suggests, it’s a rant so please don’t bother providing solutions. I’ve tried everything and I have now cancelled and booked a middle eastern airline

Edit 2 : From what I learnt from your experiences, we need to learn not to misuse our right by overstaying and using the other government’s policies to our advantage. However, this is nearly impossible because we have the biggest population and even 0.1% of bad apples is in millions. So it reduces the trust of  foreign governments and regaining their trust is extremely difficult. So basically it’s never gonna happen or take a couple of decades. It does not matter if we are the largest economy in the world.

india,all,A common person's view of BJP government since their rule started in 2014,"
This post is divided into pros & cons of Modi govt from 2014 to date.

Pros
1) rapid growth & improvement in transport infrastructure.
2) make in india initiative which enhanced the manufacturing capacity of india in some aspects & increased both domestic & foreign exports of various goods. The export sector has particularly improved.
3) terrorist attacks on civilians declined considerably. Excluding J&K, the overall civilian safety from terrorist attacks is now far better.
4) the no: of international companies & their investments increased.
5) military has been modernised & equipped with better quality weapons & various other tools to some extent.

Cons
1) various botched projects/policies such as demonetisation, GST, farmers' issues, manipur ethnic class issues, delhi/uttar pradesh communal violence & riots, aadhar card data leaks, wrestlers' issues, covid lockdown & vaccine policy & so on. Demonetisation was a fiasco. It was a ludicrous policy by govt. GST was bungled by govt to a huge extent.
2) disdain for human rights.
3) fundamentalism/bigotry & peddling of pseudoscience.

4) controlled mass media (godi media)
Bjp/nda supporters & followers while defending godi media should understand that media was one of the paramount reasons for the defeat of congress/upa government. During the rule of congress/upa govts, media was far more independent & powerful. A lot of medias were against govt. They often criticised & trolled govt. They informed the general public about govt's various issues & faults from time to time. Some of the national medias were usually on their toes to chase & find out the govt's misdeeds. This was especially very evident during the UPA 2 govt. To put it in a nutshell, media was the 4th pillar of democracy during those days. But unfortunately, today that's no more the case.

5) distraction of actual issues by diverting public attention to islamophobia/christianophobia/sikophobia & pakistan/china along with ever growing nationalism & jingoism to also deviate people from other relevant issues (to be not confused with patriotism which is the positive side).
6) religion (hinduism) and various government policies/actions are mixed with each other.
7) protection & garlanding of rapists & hate speech proponents.
8) rampant crony capitalism and all level govt corruption (gautam adani & PM CARES fund are apt examples).
9) complete lack of transparency in various govt accountability matters/incidents such as PM CARES fund.
10) suppression of citizen participation in democratic processes like RTI & improper response given to their queries by RTI.
11) inauguration of half-baked infrastructure projects. Many of these projects were & are incomplete with lack of property quality, safety & reliability at the time of their inauguration & thereafter.
12) make in india project's vision was not fully realised. There were several issues with it in respect to quality & reliability of various products. The govt failed to extensively utilise its scope & further potential.

Another point worth noting is whataboutism & blame games that are some of the major tactics which are often used by BJP govt as a part of their strategy to conceal their faults, responsibility & accountability. Although they have been ruling India for nearly a decade now & had also ruled india in some other terms before 2014, but they still keep on blaming Congress/UPA for any issues & faults which is hypocrisy to the peak. But what they fail to understand or intentionally don't realise is that they were overwhelmingly elected to form govt by the majority of indians in 2014 to fix the issues & faults of Congress/UPA government terms. But it turned out that BJP govt is far more evil & corrupted to the core along with their communal hate & divisive politics.

india,all,"India, why the double standard with ""freebies""?","Majority of developed countries provide free healthcare, free education, and often free public transport. These countries are hailed as advanced. Due to these policies, people don't need to save as much money for a rainy day and instead spend more stimulating the economy, resulting in further growth. 

In India, any such action is called a ""freebie"" and looked down upon. In Karnataka there is free public transport for women. Sure, there is a cost associated with it. But are we so blind that we can't see the huge addition to the economy if millions of women go out and work instead of sitting at home? What is the problem with reducing the barrier to leave the home? 

It seems like a plague of the rich, privileged, city population to have a problem with such things, since they have neither experienced the challenges of not having it, nor the benefit of the government making an effort to provide.

Edit, based on the discussion, in summary it seems:

1. The word ""freebie"" itself is politicised and disingenuous. The same concept is called ""welfare"" in many other countries and is hailed as positive.

2. Even if it doesn't support them directly, people here support welfare. They only want it to be thought through economically. This is absolutely 100% a fair viewpoint!

3. There is a common misconception that 98% of India doesn't pay tax. And 2% of hard working tax payers are living miserable hard lives supporting the rest.

100% of this country pays tax. Maybe not income tax, but on every purchase, on every food grain bought tax is paid. And if you think you're living a harder life than the 98% of the country that lives in poverty and often doesn't have food to eat, you're delusional. 

""Oh but my uncle's friend's brother is a farmer who earns 100cr and doesn't pay tax"". Yeah sure, but the point is about statistics. In general, farmers are poor, so in general they don't pay tax. Policies in large scale are all about ""in general"". Exceptional cases are bound to come up with large scale policies, but in general, it works. 

4. India is moving towards a system where people are demanding more basic services from government. This is not just free electricity and water, but also more development of roads, infrastructure, and environmental protection. This is good! 

Yes there will be mistakes along the way, and some policies will undoubtedly fail. But on the whole, let's keep demanding better from policy makers, let's keep the criticism up, and we will push the government to do better. Keep the pressure up guys, on both sides of the debate!

india,all,r/India will be going dark for 48 hours beginning June 12 at 12AM IST to protest the proposed API changes,"Hello r/india,

[Community has decided](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1453zzh/moderator_post_announcement_subreddit_lockdown_in/) to go private for two days starting 12th June at 12 AM, in Protest of Reddit's New API Policies and the threat they impose on Third-Party Apps' existence.

### Relevant Readings on this Topic
- [Open letter on the state of affairs regarding the API pricing and third party apps and how that will impact moderators and communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/)

- [List of Participating Subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/)

###What This Means?

It means that r/india will go private and will not be accessible publicly for two days both via web or apps. 

### Why This?
A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill many useful third party apps on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/) to [Narwhal](http://getnarwhal.com/) to [BaconReader](https://baconreader.com/).

**[Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) and [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) have already decided to shutdown permanently on June 30.**

This isn't a problem only on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

### What can you do?
You can sign the [Open Letter here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) to make your voice heard. You do not need to be a moderator to sign it. Please remember to keep your feedback free of abusive language and personal attacks.

india,all,In the light of NEET exams review of education policies in India,"I am not going to question any authority, and this is not even a political stand, but I am going to just write down a few facts related to education here. I just urge every human being to read these out loud, or even better, get a 10-year-old to read them, even they can tell there is something seriously wrong with how we are educated, and even their solution would be better than anything prevailing. These facts are so messed up and tragic that they are laughable. It's like when someone witnesses tragedy, they are sad, and if it kept on going to the point that it evolves towards stupid, crazy, and then comedy, one cannot help but laugh like stupid.

1. NTA-organized NEET-2024, results have been announced, and people who are already up to date with the news know the ridiculous results that have come. But let me state a fact: ""A general category student who has scored 720/720 cannot get into top AIIMS with this result."" So the simple question is: how much marks is expected for such a candidate to score to get a seat into top AIIMS?

2. NTA's explanation for 67 students scoring full marks and many scoring the impossible 718 and 719 is that the syllabus was mostly based on NCERT and the paper was very easy to discourage coaching mafias; so, their solution to the problem of coaching was to allow students to loose the trust in the education system and policies altogether.

3. For admission in PhD course in DU in 2017, the cut-off for SC/ST was 0 marks, which means that the candidate has to only show up and they are in. JEE mains cut-off for 2024 for the general category is 93.23, while for ST it is 46.69. How do these things even make any sense?

4. The demographics of OBC passing 12th standard is approximately 41-50% and the reservation of OBC for higher education is roughly 27%, which means that even the policies that are in place to uplift people from demographics of lower caste doesn't even help them.

5. When I was in 5th or 6th grade, I learned about reservations for the first time from our teacher of social studies. Our friends had a discussion on reservations, and all of us agreed that it was a stupid idea and that it solves nothing. At that time we concluded that giving the poor and unaware people free or partially sponsored education, giving them more support and help towards preparation of entrance exams as compared to privileged ones, and allowing them to compete with the same opportunity is a much more sustainable idea. Now, after 15 years I still believe that it was a way better idea than current reservation. Give them a reservation and privilege during their preparations and not in the admissions.

6. Ever since NTA started conducting NEET and JEE exams, there have been some problems or another. I remember earlier that these exams had a track record of everything going smoothly.

7. CBSE deleted a lot of topics in different subjects and all the deleted portions are the most important ones and are essential for entrance exams, so the students are forced to rely on coaching and work even harder to cover these topics. Let me give an example, in physics subject, CBSE deleted topics like: Laws of Motion, Gravitation, System of Particles and rotational motions, Thermodynamics, etc. which are not only very essential for a student who will most likely have to do engineering or pure science and will be forced to study in a coaching to cover these topics; and I don't have to tell you guys that these topics are so essential for any student that these topics should be a piece of common knowledge for any student. 

8. I can keep going as there are infinitely many \*\*obvious\*\* problems in India's education and this will severely affect the country. Mark my words, if this continues soon, most of the youngsters from India will be a fraud caller, like the ones who call imitating Olx buyers, delivery boys, CBI, etc. to steal or ransom people for money.",1,0,2024-06-08,amanaggupta,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1davv8v/in_the_light_of_neet_exams_review_of_education/,in the light of neet exams review of education policies in india,i am

preparation of entrance exams as compared to privileged ones and allowing them to compete with the same opportunity is a much more sustainable idea now after years i still believe that it was a way better idea than current reservation give them a reservation and privilege during their preparations and not in the admissions ever since nta started conducting neet and jee exams there have been some problems or another i remember earlier that these exams had a track record of everything going smoothly cbse deleted a lot of topics in different subjects and all the deleted portions are the most important ones and are essential for entrance exams so the students are forced to rely on coaching and work even harder to cover these topics let me give an example in physics subject cbse deleted topics like laws of motion gravitation system of particles and rotational motions thermodynamics etc which are not only very essential for a student who will most likely have to do engineering or pure science and will be forced to study in a coaching to cover these topics and i dont have to tell you guys that these topics are so essential for any student that these topics should be a piece of common knowledge for any student i can keep going as there are infinitely many obvious problems in indias education and this will severely affect the country mark my words if this continues soon most of the youngsters from india will be a fraud caller like the ones who call imitating olx buyers delivery boys cbi etc to steal or ransom people for money,light neet exams review education policies

india,all,[R] Let's discuss the BJP and Congress Manifestos,"# Resources

**[BJP Manifesto](https://www.bjp.org/en/manifesto2019)**

**[Congress Manifesto](https://manifesto.inc.in/en/)**

The BJP Manifesto is available in Hindi and English, while the Congress Manifesto is available in Hindi, English, Odia, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Punjabi, Assamese.

I've provided a few highlights from both the manifestos. The manifestos are large and it is not possible to cover all the points. I have covered the points which I believe are easier to judge on implementability.

# Observations
* Congress manifesto is longer.
* BJP Manifesto doesn't allow to copy text (even though it is a PDF document).

india,all,Your mom was right: Facebook is bad for you!,"&#x200B;

[IFF needs your support, now more than ever. Details at the end of this post.](https://preview.redd.it/k6t5i60bnzv71.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7ae1114ca9ed77d3a76d6236817db86a7685692)

## tl;dr

Two whistleblowers have revealed that Facebook is well aware of the real world harms it causes to its users and to democratic ideals worldwide, but it chooses to prioritise profit over doing the right thing. We wrote to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology asking them to initiate an inquiry into the revelations made, specifically about India and to call the relevant stakeholders to testify before it.

## Plot twist: Your mom was right!

Almost all of us have had our parents tell us to not use social media claiming that it will harm us. Turns out they were right all along, just not in the way they meant. Two whistleblowers, Ms. Frances Haugen and Ms. Sophie Zhang, have come forward with claims that Facebook is well aware of the harm its platforms cause to its users but chooses to not do everything in its power to stop this, as it would hurt the company’s bottom line.

In September 2021, Haugen submitted [**eight complaints**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s7zPvjWNaMUwCDe4gczBE_6D7chgqcok?usp=sharing) to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of the Whistleblower which allege that Facebook is knowingly withholding information and research about its shortcomings from the public and its investors. The Wall Street Journal also published a series of ten reports titled, “[**The Facebook Files: A Wall Street Journal Investigation**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039)” based on a review of internal Facebook documents, including research reports, online employee discussions and drafts of presentations to senior management through which they came to the conclusion that Facebook Inc. knows that its platforms are harmful to its users. The documents, which are the basis of the complaints and the WSJ series, were disclosed by Haugen, a former product manager hired to help protect against election interference on Facebook, who left the company early this year.  

Another whistleblower, who [**testified**](https://techpolicy.press/facebook-whistleblower-sophie-zhang-testifies-to-uk-parliament/) before the UK parliamentary committee on the Online Safety Bill, is former Facebook data scientist, Ms. Sophie Zhang. According to Zhang, Facebook is “[**allowing authoritarian governments to manipulate political discourse**](https://time.com/6107835/sophie-zhang-facebook-testimony/)”. Such manipulation is being accomplished through likes, comments, shares and reactions made by inauthentic or compromised accounts, termed as ‘fake engagement’. “[**In addition to distorting the public’s perception of how popular a piece of content is, fake engagement can influence how that content performs in the all-important news feed algorithm; it is a kind of counterfeit currency in Facebook’s attention marketplace.**](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/12/facebook-fake-engagement-whistleblower-sophie-zhang)” Zhang was specifically disturbed by how such tactics were being used in countries such as Honduras, Azerbaijan & Iraq, however when she voiced her concerns to Guy Rosen, Facebook’s Vice-President of Integrity, she was told that, priority would be given to fake engagement campaigns in ‘the US/western Europe and foreign adversaries such as Russia/Iran/etc.’ by threat intelligence.

## So what do the complaints reveal?

**Complaint**: [**Facebook misled investors and the public about its role perpetuating misinformation and violent extremism relating to the 2020 election and the January 6th insurrection**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VQ4D3V9Yy5rCghvQp-638YsztZ6gHBFe/view?usp=sharing).

According to statements made by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg before the United States Congress, Facebook has not profited from the spread of disinformation on its platforms, instead they have worked to reduce incentives for people to share misinformation to begin with. However, as per the original evidence submitted by Haugen to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of the Whistleblower, “Facebook’s records confirm that Facebook knowingly chose to permit political misinformation and violent content/groups and failed to adopt or continue measures to combat these issues, included as related to the 2020 US election and the January 6th insurrection, in order to promote virality and growth on its platforms”.

&#x200B;

**Complaint**: [**Facebook misled investors and the public about “transparency” reports boasting proactive removal of over 90% identified hate speech when internal records show that “as little as 3-5% of hate” speech is actually removed**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JQ8KKROi4TPmWre4mLs_eqZBK62P5HGd/view?usp=sharing).

Zuckerberg, in a sworn testimony before the US Congress, said that, “what are transparency reports show is that… we are proactively identifying, I think it’s about 94% of the hate speech that we ended up taking down, and the vast majority of that before people even have to report it to us”. However, according to a document titled, “Problematic Non-violating Narratives document” cited in the complaint, Facebook is deleting less than 5% of all the hate posted on its platform. Another document cited, titled, “What is collateral damage?”, goes on to state that Facebook’s core mechanics, such as virality, recommendations, and optimizing for engagement, are a significant part of why hate speech, misinformation and divisive political speech flourishes on the platform.

**Complaint**: [**Facebook misled investors and the public about the negative impact of Instagram and Facebook on teenagers’ mental and physical health**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ZA8264RfVscYgRT-I-sJ9RWujhDwPnE/view?usp=sharing).

At a US congressional hearing, Zuckerberg said that, “The research that we’ve seen is  that using social apps to connect with other people can have positive mental-health benefits”. However, the complaint reveals that research done by Facebook on the effects of its platforms show that they are harmful to children. The researchers found that:

1. 13.5% of teen girls on Instagram say the platform makes thoughts of “Suicide and Self Injury” worse;
2. 17% of teen girl Instagram users say the platform makes “eating issues” worse;
3. Instagram makes body image issues worse for 1 in 3 teen girls.

**Complaint**: [**Facebook misled investors and the public about its promotion of human trafficking/slavery/servitude**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lhGNtnXEJPL1MZ-x20htuJWqoF2jriJL/view?usp=sharing).

According to the complaint, Facebook’s internal research has shown that the “platform enables all three stages of the human exploitation lifecycle” (recruitment, facilitation & exploitation) and that they were aware that Facebook and Instagram were being used to promote human trafficking and domestic servitude.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qqq2sd9chxv71.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b55a98ea05801870a1a6c972c25e3549f989fb69

**Complaint**: [**Facebook misled investors and the public about the negative consequences of its algorithms, which claim to prioritize “meaningful social interactions” or MSI but which actually promote virality of polarizing misinformation and hate speech**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RoEasV4MdXtyEaiVcwtVd8DW4iskiCZF/view?usp=sharing).

According to statements made by Facebook and Zuckerberg, its algorithms prioritize “meaningful social interactions”, which means that the algorithm prioritizes content which has a higher probability of getting any type of interaction, such as reactions, comments, shares or likes. However, even though Facebook claims that this is beneficial for relationships and well-being, “internal documents highlight how prioritizing MSI such as reshares actually furthers misinformation and other divisive, low-quality content”. According to a document cited in the complaint titled, “We are Responsible for Viral Content”, research has shown that outrage and misinformation are more likely to be viral.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wiwue37chxv71.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fa0f5b040313a394e5a7534e2b82795658dfd42

**Complaint**: [**Facebook misled its investors and the public about equal enforcement of its terms given that high-profile users are “whitelisted” under its “XCheck” program**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yfI3oYf0tpZ1vVIOLw9IkL12G_6CUQvX/view?usp=sharing).  

According to Zuckerberg’s sworn testimony before the US Congress, Facebook applies its terms of service in a “fair and consistent” manner. He further stated that, “(i)ncitement of violence is against our policy and there are not (sic) exceptions to that, including for politicians”. However, according to a document cited in the complaint, titled, “Whitelisting”, “over the years many XChecked pages, profiles and entities have been exempted from enforcement”.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fqhh657chxv71.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23f619c30e430b728a0553d37c7d852a120b312b

**Complaint**: [**Facebook misled investors and the public about “bringing the world closer together” where it relegates international users and promotes global division and ethnic violence**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Acu0nDbm9zMPgIN9xc7qqDUWC6lwT77q/view?usp=sharing).

According to claims made by Facebook, it has 2.8 billion users around the world, and that it is committed to international issues. However, Haugen submitted original evidence on how Facebook is failing to curb global misinformation and ethnic violence due to inadequate language capabilities. Currently, Facebook is available in more than 100 different languages with offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries. According to a statement made by Facebook in May 2021 to the US Committee on Energy and Commerce, they work with over 80 independent third party fact-checkers around the world covering more than 60 languages to combat misinformation in these languages. However, according to original evidence submitted by Haugen to the SEC this is inadequate to satisfactorily respond to misinformation and violence inciting statements in regional languages and dialects.    

The complaint also contains an excerpt from a “Adversarial Harmful Networks: India Case Study” which made the following specific disclosure how such misinformation and incitement takes place in India through Facebook,

>“RSS \[Indian nationalist organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh\] Users, Groups, and Pages promote fear-mongering, anti-Muslim narratives targeted pro-Hindu populations with V&l (violence and inciting) intent. ...There were a number of dehumanizing posts comparing Muslims to 'pigs' and 'dogs' and misinformation claiming the Quran calls for men to rape their female family members. Our lack of Hindi and Bengali classifiers means much of this content is never flagged or actioned, and we have yet to put forth a nomination for designation of this group given political sensitivities.”

Facebook is also aware that its core product mechanics such as virality, recommendations and optimising for engagement are a significant reason why misinformation and hate speech flourishes on their platforms with almost 1-1.5 million misinformation impressions in India per hour due to reshares.

&#x200B;

**Complaint**: [**For years, Facebook has misled investors and advertisers about shrinking user base in important demographics, declining content production, and the true number of recipients of “Reach & Frequency” advertising**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WKg6Yhwhr83YTAxOjno_lvteA2Wj-92V/view?usp=sharing).

Misinformation is also spread at a large scale in India through duplicate accounts or SUMA, which stands for “single user, multiple accounts”. The complaint also claims that for years, Facebook has misrepresented its true number of individual users to advertisers, not properly accounting for ""single users with multiple accounts"". According to a document referred to as “Lotus Mahal” in the complaints filed, such accounts are used by political actors in India to spread politically sensitive information.

## Our recommendations

In light of these damning revelations, it is incumbent upon the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology to ensure that these revelations are investigated thoroughly to understand the possible ramifications of Facebook and its group of companies on Indian citizens and democracy. Therefore, we urged the Committee to initiate an inquiry into these disclosures and call the two whistleblowers, Ms. Frances Haugen and Ms. Sophie Zhang to give testimony to the committee on the revelations made, specifically in the context of India and Indian users of Facebook. Further, as it has previously sent summons and sought testimony from Facebook representatives and Mr. Ajit Mohan, who is the Vice President and Managing Director, Facebook India, specifically, further summons may be sent to him to appear before the committee so that the necessary investigation can be carried out.

india,all,If not Modi then who?,"Pre-2016 Narendra Modi.

The Narendra Modi characterised by his emphasis on development, anti-corruption stance, and opposition to dynasty politics that had and continues to plague our opposition space (bar the commies) and now, after 10 years of Modi’s rule, the BJP as well. The version of Modi that focused on economic growth, tackling inflation, modernising the military, enhancing quality of life for its citizens (UPI, VIP vehicles barred), and enhancing India's international standing. The Modi that took corruption head on via DBT and e-Assessments under ITA. The Modi that provided banking services, built toilets, and provided gas connection to our fellow citizens who were hitherto deprived of these services for 70 odd years. The Modi that rose to power without a single mention of polarising issues such as the Ram Mandir, anti-Muslim rhetoric, or Pakistan-centric narratives. The Modi that created an environment of positivity and optimism, the Modi who would herald *Aacche Din*. Modi from the time when his agenda and policies appeared more centrist and focused on governance rather than identity politics.

Not the cult leader Modi of today. Not the one who justifies what *prima facie* appears as blatant extortion scheme/probable money laundering scheme, not after all those tall lectures on corruption. Not the one who seeks votes because of his caste, or his religion. Let the opposition do it, you don’t leverage the same ailments in our republic that you sought to destroy. It was *Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas,* it should remain so. Not the Modi who’s carrying out the world’s grandest social engineering project that seeks to take our country back at least a 100 years. Not the Modi who lies between his teeth’s and stomps upon anyone who dares correct him. Not the Modi who looks aside on tragedies such as Manipur, for over a year, as there are no political dividends to be yielded by intervening. Not the megalomaniac, narcissist who has surrounded himself with sycophants of the highest order whose propensity to derriere licking is obnoxiously nauseating. Not the tunnel vision politician who didn’t even spare his octogenarian mother for PR during Demonetisation, who left her funeral midway so that the limelight of momentous inauguration of the first Vande Bharat in the East would not be hogged by Mamata Banerjee.

This Modi.

I’m as novice as it comes, but imho following the Bihar loss in 2015, and Bengal loss in 2016, Modi was disillusioned. He realised, as, in addition to electoral defeats, he faced further set backs on several schemes such as Make in India and Clean Ganga, that India at large is nowhere near the efficiency levels of an enterprising state such as Gujarat. And Indians do not really vote for progress, but hard and fast cash. Especially TMC sweeping Bengal notwithstanding Sarada and Narada Scams probably drove that point home.

Thereafter, you could observe this change that saw a greater focus on winning elections through strategies that are blatantly divisive and polarising. An entire generation is being raised to hate people who they’re gonna spend their lives in the company of. Dancing outside mosques, pelting stones from ceilings, this is what our youth is procuring their dopamine from. A mockery has been made of our constitutional bodies and individuals. Using ED to harass opposition, co-opting media to a degree that would make Putin blush, using Governors to impede the functioning of opposition ruled states. These precedents are irreversible. Modi won’t be here forever, so in a language that his fanbase understands, “*Khangress might come to power someday, and they will use the same tools to affect their anti-national, anti-hindu agenda.*” Are we prepared? No kidding.

He threw the entire economy into the gutter to win UP elections (ie Demonetisation), he disappeared in the face of the most severe crisis India faced since, idk, partition perhaps? (Covid 2021). Our people were dying like rats, and there was no accountability, no repercussions, no response. He resorts to deflecting blame on men who have been long dead to cover up for his own incompetence even after 10 years of unbridled power. 1 km of 4 lanes is now considered 4 kms, if electricity is provided to 10% households in a particular village, it is deemed that the entire village has been electrified, these are jacking up numbers, these numbers are then being proliferated at pace which can be considered as a form of disinformation especially as there are some nefarious devils in the details. Organised an event that is allocated without any merit, and projected it as being a mega achievement to his gullible followers. And now they want to host COP26 before 2029 elections which would imply they intend to keep Indians dumb and gullible for another 5 years at least.

Polarisation of public and pulverisation of republic (I came up with this and I love it).

Not to imply that there are no positives under Modi. He has delivered on several fronts, most significant of which was national security. Yes there were quite a few terror attacks in his regime as well but let’s not forget the pre-2014 weekly terror attacks. No city, no state was spared or safe.

Where it wasn’t Islamists or Pakistan sponsored terrorists, we had militants. A relative of mine was shot dead in 2009 by HNLC militants for not agreeing to what would be a fifth ransom payment.

Economy was handed the triple shock of Demonetisation, GST and 2019 Union Budget but since then they’ve tempered with it to a controlled degree. Our tax incidence has reduced without damaging our fiscal position (I may be culturally liberal, but fiscally I’m as conservative as they come) and in spite of the plethora of challenges NDA 2 faced (Covid, Ukraine War, Houthi attacks all of which pressurised Brent crude), they are not withering from the targets to consolidate our debts. I appreciate how he’s not backing down against outside intervention in our fragile state of Punjab. There is unprecedented (world class and not just basic) infrastructural development. This and many more, I’ve directly not been a direct beneficiary of anything as such, but he has a 70 odd percent approval rating, I’m assuming those in mainland are getting something at least.

I may criticise Modi all I want but truth be told he possesses the potential to enact transformative change in India and could change the fortunes of the country by his sheer cult of personality. If we could just impose certain costs that would make him focus on prioritising governance over electoral victories and refrain from divisive tactics such as conniving, lying, manipulating, and gas-lighting others to that end, which we know he’s capable of, he very well could go down as India’s Ataturk. Per the status quo, though, he’s gonna go down as the Hindu Zia ul Haq who converted—although scarcely but functionally—a secular India into Hindu Pakistan. Those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Its that simple, really.

If we could remind him, who he is, if we could just make him come out of this mega whatever induced trip that he’s on, and realise he will be remembered for longer if he makes us rich than he will be for refurbishing temple arenas, that could and would transform our fortunes. If we could somehow… he will be given the power, he and his team has the vision, enough manpower and with some effort he could get the money as well. If we could just remind him his mode of effective and efficient governance, and not he, was supposed to be the Gujarat Model that India gets, minus the minority stomping and oligarchy appeasement ofc, that’d be great.

Aayega toh Modi hi, toh kyun na pre-2016 Modi ko laye?

Because otherwise, think about it, this inducting members into the party regardless of their character so long as they augur positive electoral outcomes, vociferously targeting super-majority in parliament, stomping on small time politicians which one could construe as a lab rat experiment for bigger things to come, what the they up to?

Whatever that is, if it isn’t what Modi promised in 2014, it portends dangerous, ominous signals.

india,all,Bengal Famine of 1943 - Causes,"My chief sources on the Bengal famine are,

* Poverty and Famines by Amartya Sen

* Unpatriotic history of the Second World War by James Hartfield

* Churchill's Secret War by Madhulikha Mukherjee

>Bengal Famine was mostly due to bad weather culminating to crop failure. 

False. It has been established unequivocally by Sen that 43 had a bumper harvest, food supply was actually increased as compared to 1941. The British were however EXPORTING wheat and Rice was used as a substitute grain to make up for the shortfall caused by wheat exports and this caused a net shortfall.

I will repeat this, Bengal had a better than normal harvest, but the Brits were exporting wheat from India to sustain the British war effort and Rice was used to make up for this shortfall. 

>Burmese foodstocks were destroyed by the Japanese causing shortages in Bengal. 

It was not the ""Japs"" that destroyed food stocks, the food stocks were destroyed even before the Japanese came into Burma thanks to a scorched earth policy. Not only this the Brits seized all modes of transport (primarily boats) that small farmers (the majority of them) used to transport said rice to small local markets.
Repeated requests to release these modes of transport was rejected, and not till 1944 was this done.
The INA even offered 100,000 tons of rice from captured areas (which the Brits hadn't scorch earthed yet), the British rejected it.

Not only did the British reject Bose's offer, they rejected an offer of 10,000 tons from Canada. The US made an offer for another 100,000 tons, but due to British pressure they backed down. Australia offered another ~ 25,000 tons of wheat but guess what Churchill did? He diverted these food stocks to the Mediterranean to stock up for the Tunisia Campaign - Churchill's own command said they had adequate stocks, but nope, Churchill flat out refused to supply Bengal using Australian stocks.

With me so far? All this is meticulously documented via telegrams, cables, letters and memoirs. 

What was Churchill's response to this....request for food?

>> Isn't Gandhi dead? What a pity.

>> They are to be blamed, Indians breed like rabbits

>> They are a beastly people with a beastly religion

It was so bad (Churchill and his govt's attitude) that no less a person than the Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell said,

>> Churchill's attitude towards India and the famine is negligent, hostile and contemptuous.

* Lord Wavell, Viceroy of India.


Lord Wavell bemoaned the fact that Argentina BURNED 2 Mn tonnes of wheat as a substitute for coal (as there was a global shortage) and his offers to ship wheat using Indian shipping was shot down  by the Churchill govt.


It got so bad that the British Seceretary of State in India, Leopold Amery said that Churchill had a Hitler like attitude towards India and Indians. Yes, Churchill was called Hitler by his own Secy of state, but 'famine was caused by 'natural disasters' right? 

Now we go back in time (time for Economics 101) to 1939. India had been supporting the British war effort substantially, iirc we contributed to the tune of 3 Bn GBP (a huge huge sum in 1941) by 1942. How did the Colonial govt deal with this? They printed more Rupees. What does printing of currency do? Cause massive inflation. What does inflation do? Increase the prices of foodgrains (and everything else). Without the war effort  such an inflation wouldn't have occured, and 3 Mn Bengalis needn't have died in vain. 

With me so far?

* Churchill

Churchill was as racist and as much of a bully as Hitler was, but sadly see he is projected as an all conquering hero. 

* India had to support the war effort in Europe while at the same time the INA were traitors.

Do you not see the ridiculous irony in the ""brave allies"" fighting for freedom and democracy while at the same time holding India as a colony? 

What the fuck was the difference between German occupied France and British occupied India?

edit - I don't care about votes and downvotes, but there is this clique here that seems to think only one camp (the right) does downvoting. Look at my post, within 30 seconds of posting it was down to 30%, went up to 80% and now back down to 70%.

This is not even a political post, and yet some users here see fit to downvote it blindly. Can we please put the canard that ""only one set"" downvotes to rest? The unfortunate fact is some users (cutting across camps) downvote blindly and on the basis of usernames and not content.

india,all,Reforms needed in reservation policy of India,"There is much need of reform in the reservation provided to people of SC/ST community. Governments like the current one are the result of the preferential treatment/ handout provided to people from SC/ST communities. And this is coming from a person who has used this policy to get admission in college and job. 

People from SC/ST communities are not inherently weaker in studies, but these policies imply otherwise. During interaction of Ambedkar with Gandhi, the former said that the latter wanted Dalits/Adivasis to live at the mercy of the people who are traditionally included in the varna system.

Even after getting selected with lower marks suppose in a Govt. company , there will always be people doubting your competence. Even after someone from the SC/ST community is able to accomplish a difficult task it will not be recognised and will be swept under the rug. People who are selected from the general category can be lazing around no one will question their competence and work ethic. 

Finally, in SC category contains around 50 - 80 castes (depending on the state). Also it is not necessary the SCs have anything in common, or they will help out someone just because they are in the same caste. We should outlaw the chaturvarna system as their definitions have lost their meaning  , and strive to automate jobs which are termed as unclean, or use machines/chemicals to make the job easier and not impose these tasks to a child born in the ""Dom"" community as was practiced before and is idealised today. 

Reservation system can be abolished if steps are taken by the government to see to it that policies/ practices of Britishers / Manusmriti is not followed or adopted in the present world. If a committed government takes power in the centre alot of things are possible and they can rid our country off the caste based hell in which our country is going through and continue to do so.

TLDR: Reservation should be abolished albeit with measures taken for social and economic prosperity of the depressed castes.",0,21,2021-04-28,Redditthrowaway9969,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/n08n2y/reforms_needed_in_reservation_policy_of_india/,reforms needed in reservation policy of india,there is much need of reform in the reservation provided to people of scst community governments like the current one are the result of the preferential treatment handout provided to people from scst communities and this is coming from a person who has used this policy to get admission in college and job people from scst communities are not inherently weaker in studies but these policies imply otherwise during interaction of ambedkar with gandhi the former said that the latter wanted dalitsadivasis to live at the mercy of the people who are traditionally included in the varna system even after getting selected with lower marks suppose in a govt company there will always be people doubting your competence even after someone from the scst community is able to accomplish a difficult task it will not be recognised and will be swept under the rug people who are selected from the general category can be lazing around no one will question their competence and work ethic finally in sc category contains around castes depending on the state also it is not necessary the scs have anything in common or they will help out someone just because they are in the same caste we should outlaw the chaturvarna system as their definitions have lost their meaning and strive to automate jobs which are termed as unclean or use machineschemicals to make the job easier and not impose these tasks to a child born in the dom community as was practiced before and is idealised today reservation system can be abolished if steps are taken by the government to see to it that policies practices of britishers manusmriti is not followed or adopted in the present world if a committed government takes power in the centre alot of things are possible and they can rid our country off the caste based hell in which our country is going through and continue to do so tldr reservation should be abolished albeit with measures taken for social and economic prosperity of the depressed castes,reforms needed reservation policy india,much need reform reservation provided people scst community governments like current one result preferential treatment handout provided people scst communities coming person used policy get admission college job people scst communities inherently weaker studies policies imply otherwise interaction ambedkar gandhi former said latter wanted dalitsadivasis live mercy people traditionally included varna system even getting selected lower marks suppose govt company always people doubting competence even someone scst community able accomplish difficult task recognised swept rug people selected general category lazing around one question competence work ethic finally sc category contains around castes depending state also necessary scs anything common help someone caste outlaw chaturvarna system definitions lost meaning strive automate jobs termed unclean use machineschemicals make job easier impose tasks child born dom community practiced idealised today reservation system abolished steps taken government see policies practices britishers manusmriti followed adopted present world committed government takes power centre alot things possible rid country caste based hell country going continue tldr reservation abolished albeit measures taken social economic prosperity depressed castes,False,-0.2070147544145584,Neutral,Real Text
india,all,I'll try to summarize what's happening in India & how the present GOI has approached the minds of the commoners.,"**BJP** came to power with the help of mass media (which of course is not a problem) & its promises towards inflation, unemployment & most important protection of the Hindu religion. **Before going ahead, I'd like to tell ya that I'm an atheist & I don't give a damn about any religion whatsoever**. I'm politically inclined towards the AAP party but that doesn't mean I'm a blind follower or a devotee. 

Now, BJP used its brain toward pro-Hindu policy by making its MLAs & MPs say that India will be a Hindu Rastra. But, their prime leaders like Modi, Shah, Rajnath, Sitaraman, Jaitly, etc never said that. 

They gained the Hindu votes in major states due to the pro-Hindu image & on the other hand, by removing triple talaq, they also gained the trust of Muslim household women. 

Now, the problem is that they've blindfolded their followers to the extent that they don't question even their wrongdoings. Whether, it was a pensioner scheme, TDS, GST, demonization, farmer bill, etc... BJPs followers just don't ask questions & that's the most powerful tool. We know that crime in the BJP-ruled states is almost the same, rapes, and kidnappings are common.  ED, CBI, ITD, and NCB have given clean cheat to BJP & they don't raid them.  There are more than  40% of criminal record MPs in parliament from the Bjp's side.   BJP came with the policy of MLAs buying scenario by which they destroyed the opposition. Current & former presidents too are puppets of the BJP. 

Business tycoon Loans were written of lakhs of crore. Privatization has more cons than pros. 

**Work done by bjp gov in power:** BJP gov. has done good work in the bringing of the internet & UPI. Its foreign policy is also fairly good. We've got many jets & upgraded weapons etc. THEREFORE, not everything is bad. 

**BJP has fooled Hindus by saying Hindu rastra etc but people need to understand that they're lying for votes & there will be no Hindu rastra. If that happens then there will be riots & we'll be back to -30 years.**  

**The opposition too is insignificant**. They don't have a face. Rahul Gandhi is a kid I pity. Mamta isn't worth it. Kejriwal is fairly good but he has no chance for 2024. 

&#x200B; Forgot to mention china: everyone knows china has built villages aside from borders & valleys & when we ask this question, bjp counter-attack with a protection policy by bringing the Indian army into the middle.

india,all,Just wanting to know how optimistic people are about the ongoing protests in India regarding CAA-NRC ? Do they think that by this (protests) there is going to be any change in the government implementation of these misguided/flawed policies?,"I have had this discussion with my girlfriend a lot of times regarding the NRC-CAA. 

She has been quite pessimistic since CAA was a bill. She has been saying this government isn't going to do anything about it. On the contrary I have been a bit optmistic regarding all this. Initially I thought that supreme court will intervene (knowing current president is a stamp man, no better than peon putting stamps for the officer). But it has been a month now. CAB become CAA and UP has already started the implementation.

Though there has been a lot of protest and uproar regarding the policies across India, the government conveniently ignored everything and carried on the implementation. 

I have been to both the protests - Jamia and Shaheen bagh, there always have been a huge gathering, esp. Shaheen bagh, which has been on for 24x7 since last one month. I have been challenging her that these people coming up for protest, specially the women, who has been the life of Shaheen bagh protest, has to look after their family as well, aren't doing this for fun. There must be a bit optmistic regarding the situation, giving there all. Although she has been going to protect regularly, she is still quite pessimistic regarding everything.

So I want to know, how many people actually see a hope to all the protests that has been happening across India. Is there a point to it ? Do you think, for once government, which should be for the people, will listen and bring down NRC implementation atleast ?

Is there any other reason/motivation to all the protest if government isn't going to budge regarding the implementation.

Is she being a realist and I'm still being naive believing in false hopes ?

PS: I have been hating the government since the start, not siding knowing all the chutiyapa this government is up to.

Update: goverment won't be changing their decision - we all know that for a fact, it's the supreme court's ruling that i wanted to emphasize upon. Will supreme court be making any decision regarding the CAA and NRC in the favour of people.

india,all,Never join a Tier-4 Engineering College in India,"Feeling worthless, so thought about writing this so that a select few aspirants that lurk here don't end up screwing their lives like me. So, after my 12th, I gave JEE Mains and scored around 50k All India Rank. Like most aspirants, I was confident that if I drop a year and do a full-fledged preparation, I'll be able to land into at least a decent tier-2 college. So I took a year drop to prepare for JEE. Things were going well. Until one day, when I fell ill with malaria. My whole preparation stopped and went down the drain. I started falling behind in my syllabus and couldn't recover. Came the result and bam! I couldn't even qualify for JEE advanced (more than 150k rank). I had a smart group of friends and saw all of them get into good colleges. I was depressed af and had no one to share all this with. I always believed I could have done better and could still do better, so took another year drop (my 2nd-year drop). That one year was brutal. I stopped going out, fearing my neighbors and friends would ask me about my career. I didn't tell anyone about my results since I was very embarrassed. Changed my number and disappeared from all of social media. My preparation started well because of all the fire that was lit in me. But very quickly it ran out. I wasn't able to concentrate on my studies and got saturated with self-study with no human interaction. Midway through my preparation, I knew this time I'll screw even harder. The results came in and I scored 80k rank in JEE mains. Since I wasn't getting into any of the good colleges with such a rank, I did not want to go to any other city, so I chose a college in my city. When I read some reviews about it on Google, I got the impression that the college is decent and some companies come every year for recruiting. Little did I know that I was reading very old reviews and the college used to be decent 5 years ago before some corruption charges against the director came to light and companies pretty much blacklisted the college.

On my first day at college, I came to know about this. Most of my classmates were rude, ill-witted, and dim, and they only took admission because of the college's low fees. For a lack of my word power, you know the typical UP chapri kind. I felt so out of place and regretted all my life decisions that day. The college had no permanent faculty for many subjects, and people who had no business teaching CSE, and who I doubt even knew how to make a PowerPoint, taught us. To make things worse and to ensure that no student ever learns on their own and succeeds, they had a strict attendance policy. There was even one teacher that would beat students if they missed college without any convincing reason. Almost my entire day used to get wasted in college learning pretty much nothing. College sucked all the confidence, self-esteem, and motivation that I used to have out of me. I just made one good friend and don't have any one of those fond ""college memories."" I used to be an extrovert in school, but now I find it so hard to socialize. In school, I used to be good at speaking English, now I have very low confidence in English. All I have are regrets. I won't ever forgive myself for choosing that college.

Fast forward to now. I graduated in 2021 without any job offer. I prepared for CAT last year for an MBA. I scored a decent 95%ile in CAT and cleared some other entrances too. I even scored a 99.85%ile in an entrance exam called SNAP. But before you think I'm going to turn this into an inspiring story, I'd have to stop you right there. In the 10 interviews that I gave for various MBA colleges, I couldn't crack even one. In all the interviews I lacked confidence, and whenever they did a stress interview I cracked since I had no experience of interacting in English during my 4 years in college and possessed so little confidence. I know for a fact that the ""school-me"" would have done a lot better in those interviews. Now I have no job, no college, and no happiness. My father has reduced talking to me since I've been such an unemployed failure for the past year. Ever since my disastrous MBA interviews, I have been trying to get a job, but I couldn't get anything yet. Every day I would go to various companies' pages and fill/upload my details for each site to apply for a job. I know through a LinkedIn profile I would be able to apply quicker, but I lack the courage and don't want my school friends and relatives to find out how big of a fall I've taken since school. Working and becoming independent should not be a luxury but a basic human right. Sometimes life feels so unfair. I'm about to turn 25 in a few months and have seen so many of my childhood friends get to such great heights. I used to be such a happy and confident student in school with so many dreams.

india,all,"Tomorrow, workers across India will go on a two-day nationwide strike. They need your support.","**Edit: You don't have to agree with all the demands. Support for empathy and solidarity. Support for what you consider just.**

**Edit: [This](https://old.reddit.com/r/librandu/comments/pd4uue/psa_privatization_of_india_should_concern_you/ ""PSA: Privatization of India should concern You"") is a detailed post I had written about privatization a while back. I am astonished how many redditors are vehemently against any opposition to privatization. Please read before making another comment how opposing privatization is naive/foolish/impossible.**

Tomorrow, workers across India will go on a two-day general strike. The nationwide strike has been called by 10 central trade unions and independent federations, and is supported by Samyukta Kisan Morcha. The strike is for scrapping of four labour codes, end to privatization, fulfillment of promises made to farmers, among other things.

Their demands are:

- Four labor codes should be abolished, the law prohibiting strikes in the defense sector - EDSA should be repealed.
- After the repeal of the agricultural laws, the promises made to the Samyukta Kisan Morcha should be fulfilled.
- Do not accept privatization in any form, cancel the privatization and National Monetization Plan.
- Provide cash and free ration assistance of Rs 7500 per month to non income tax paying families.
- Increase allocation for MGNREGA and expand employment guarantee scheme in urban areas.
- Give universal social security to all informal sector workers, formalize the informal sector.
- Provide statutory minimum wage and social security to Anganwadi, ASHA, mid-day meal and other scheme workers by giving them the status of laborers.
- Provide proper protection and insurance for frontline workers serving the people amid the Corona pandemic.
- Increase government investment in agriculture, education, health and other important public utilities by taxing the rich through wealth tax etc. to revive and improve the national economy.
- Substantial reduction in central excise duty on petroleum products, concrete remedial measures should be taken to check price rise.
- Regularize contract workers, plan workers and provide equal pay for equal work.
- Repeal the new pension scheme, restore the old pension scheme, substantially increase the minimum pension under the Employees' Pension Scheme.


On November 10th, 2021, trade unions held a National Convention in Delhi. The convention gave a call for two-day general strike against the government’s policies, to be held on February 23-24 (during the budget season), among other programs. The date was later shifted to March 28-29 due to the assembly elections.

india,all,"Open challenge to all Nehru bashers - name three founding fathers, in past century, who did a better job for their country than what JLN did for India. I tried to do this exercise as a joke but was astonished when I utterly failed","Since the advent of fb/twitter I have always witnessed Nehru being lynched left right and center, never thought much about it. Few months back Zimbabwe underwent a coup and it got me thinking why no coup in India, not even an attempt to coup?  Are there any other countries like us? Upon a bit of googling I came up with a map(link in the comments)  Boy oh boy! India seems like an oasis of tranquility in middle of a huge shitstorm called Asia! 

-------------------------------------------


The problem with debating Nehru is that the neither side will ever get convinced of the other guy's argument on points like economics, defence, Kashmir, Patel, Netaji, Edwina etc.  So rather than being stuck in the same loop why not try to find few guys who did better than JLN. 

In order to give a tough fight to Nehru the contender should 

- Remain alive and serve for at least 5yrs

- Not be a dictator (hold fair elections)

- Keep the country in one piece without civil wars

- Belong to a country at least as big as Bangalore City (1 crore population)

- Do some good things 

Funny as they seem, first 3 factors eliminate 90% of the candidates. Lets start!



**Our immediate neighbours** 

- Jinnah(Pak), wasn't even alive for 17 months let alone 17yrs of service. Liaquat Ali, his deputy, failed to finalize constitution, imposed one language one religion formula all over nation etc. We all know the rest of clusterf*** saga

- Mujib (Bdesh), ruled 4yrs, famine in 1974, heavy nepotism, failed nationalization, failed to hold elections at local level, Jatiya bahini to kill opponents, and finally declared emergency in 74, banned all opposition parties, frustrated army takes a tank to his doorstep and kills his entire clan

- Sennayake (SL) died within 4 yrs, volatility of 5 PMs in next 8 yrs , Tamils were not happy with his citizenship laws, which disenfranchised all Tamils, later PM Bandarnaike passed Sinhala only act which planted the seed of LTTE

- ??? (Nepal) A decade long civil war led to democracy which had 8 PMs since 2008

- Aung San (Myanmar), he was their only chance of uniting the numerous ethnic minorities and disparate political groups, but was killed before gaining power and so began the usual civil war


**East Asia** 

- Mao (China) his activities made hitler look like a cute teddy bear. In his first five years, he killed about 4 to 6 million by indiscriminately sentencing them to death. His policies also starved about 20 million citizens

- Papa Kim ( N Korea) they have a nuke button now!!

- Syngman Rhee ( S Korea ) Ruled for 12yrs as dictator. enacted laws that severely curtailed political dissent, assassinated opponents, ordered massacres, entire Rhee regime was notorious for its corruption and caused death of thousands in scams, rigged elections and eventually driven out of country by protestors 

- Chiang Kai-shek ( Taiwan ) Ruled for 20yrs as dictator, enacted ""temporary provision"" to nullify constitution and impose martial law, these provisions lasted for 4 decades. his party KMT was so notorious that public thought of the then past Japanese oppressors as 'benevolent rulers'. 

**South Asia** 

- Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam) conceived the brilliant idea of violating international ceasefire and started the biggest clusterf*** war of post WW2 era,  died fighting it

- Sukarno (Indonesia) could not bring together Islamists, communists and secularists. Millitary refused to accept his orders and 1st VP resigned in protest of his policy, forced to declare martial law, caused 600% inflation and communist massacre in 1965, finally got impeached and died in house arrest

- Tunku ( Malaysia) not dictator, elected twice, no civil wars, seems like a winner!! Anyhow expelled Singapore in 1965,  race riots in kuala lampur 1969 led to his resignation. He was the *first guy who I thought was eligible to be a contender* to JLN, but not many big achievements. Overall a nice guy who emphasized on secularism and democracy.

- ??? (Philippines) none of the guys ruled for more than 4yrs till Marcos who imposed martial law, ruled for 20 yrs and when shit hit the fan, fled to Hawaii 

- ??? (Cambodia) took them 40 years after independence to elect first PM.


**USSR and her daughters**

- Lenin (Soviet I) ruled 5yrs as dictator, 5yrs of civil war, killed thousands in concentration camps, 1-2 million died in famine.

- Stalin (Soviet II) ruled 30yrs as dictator, dude was worse than Hitler but better than Mao. 

- Belarus, same guy ruling since independence. 24 yrs 

- Kazakhstan, Same dictator ruling since independence. gets 90-97% votes every term 

- Uzbekistan, Same guy ruled as president for 25 years till the day he died in office 

- Tajikstan, same story as above, Prez for 24 yrs, bonus prequel: one civil war and 2 coup attempts

- Azerbaijan, 25 years of father son pair as president, bonus prequel: 6 yr long ethnic cleansing + war with 30k deaths and half a million displaced and yeah 2 military coups

All five of the above countries are not recognized as democracies in the Global Democracy Index.

**Other examples**

- Tito (Yugoslavia)  ruled 36yrs as dictator, persecuted oppo leaders/poets, debt increased at 17% for two decades. He was more liberal than other communist dictators. His eventual failure - legacy not strong enough to keep the nation in one piece.

- Ataturk (Turkey) ruled for 15yrs this guy established a solid democracy, the only one in the world with a better record of regular elections than India! Many good policies like- voting rights for women in 1930!, made primary education free,  had the courage to express regret for Armenian genocide. Can be considered a very solid contender vs Nehru. 

- Mandela (South Africa), ruled 5 yrs officially but effectively it was 2-3 years. In 1997 he said ""defacto ruler of RSA is Mbeki my VP""   

- Ayatollah (Iran) , less said the better

- Saddam (Iraq), why don't we ask him, oh wait...

- Entire Continent of South America was disastrous 'khichdi' of coups and military dictatorships in 1960s-70s with uncle Sam dipping  his dirty fingers everywhere.

- Entire Continent of Africa (30+ countries), I skipped them as any of them didn't seem remarkable enough. Maybe I am unaware of some special cases.

- Lee Kuan Yew (Singapore) was perhaps the only guy I found to be beating Nehru comprehensively ~~in a democratic way~~ but he did so with a country smaller than city of Ahmedabad and for the sake of fairness to Nehru I am only considering nations with at least 1crore population. Ataturk comes very near but still can't match up, please mention reasons if you disagree. 

Edits

- Many of made me aware that Lee Kuan Yew was [not democratic](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/03/lee-kuan-yew-conundrum-democracy-singapore/388955/) in strict sense. He was anyway not qualifying 1 crore criteria, but I have edited the previous line.

- ~~We have a winner!! - Bostwana founding father Seretse Khama was mentioned and I agree. Ruled for 14 yrs managed to make sane country lacking militia groups and corruption. Two more to go!!~~ When somebody commented I checked the wiki and misread population of 2 million as 2 crore. Bostwana seems to be smaller than South Delhi! We are back to zero :-( 

**CONCLUSION -**
-

IITs IIMs ISRO and India's nuclear program are the most minuscule components of Nehru's legacy. As seen in this global carnage it is not a mere coincidence that we survived with 


- ZERO civil wars ( China, Mexico, SL)

- ZERO famines (we had 12 under Brits) 

- ZERO secession ( Singapore, Taiwan, Bdesh) 

- ZERO coups ( 95% of countries )

- ZERO state sponsored GENOCIDE 

- NO disintegration of territory ( Yugoslavia, USSR and Gran Colombia)

I am in no way a big fan, his deep distrust/contempt of Army was perhaps the biggest reason we lost 1962. And yet it is the same distrust which led him to abolish post of commander in chief and split up the unified armed forces hierarchy into three separate commands. A bigger achievement than ZERO COUPS is zero attempts to coup, we take such an unshakable foundation for granted. Every damn political observer had predicted India to collapse spectacularly, none of them could foresee that we would adopt universal voting rights on the very 1st day, none could foresee that we would establish Non Aligned Movement rather than selling allegiance to a super power, none could foresee that we would adapt linguistic pluralism with elegant state reorganization. And that's why despite being the GUY WHO SINGLE-HANDEDLY LOST HIS NATION A WAR Nehru was among the best leaders of the century!


**BIG EDIT**
Some chaps have completely misunderstood my assertion, if given a choice to be born in a country India will without doubt be in bottom 10% of my list, almost all countries are better than us in terms of HDI and prosperity. The assertion here is in context of *""FOUNDING FATHERS"" of nations with comparable population* i.e. at least 1 crore.  I am not hailing Nehru as the ultimate best, I am simply saying that he would be in top 5% and we should acknowledge that truth.

india,all,Don’t Blame BJP. Don’t Blame Opposition. Don’t blame anyone else but ourselves. The fault is ours. Here’s a couple of things we can do to start with.,"**Reddit/Twitter** is full of complaints:

1. **Shitting** on the **BJP**.
2. **Criticizing** the **opposition** for failing to stop the **BJP** and being weak.
3. **Blaming** the **Godi media** for being biased.
4. **Losing hope** on **Judiciary** since it is **50/50 compromised**.

But these posts overlook the most important aspect: the role we, the citizens, play in a democracy.

Better functioning democracies thrive because engaged citizens hold their governments accountable. They demand better and participate in civil society.

We, on the other hand, merely **rant online** while our democracy crumbles before our own eyes.

It’s useless to blame others and expect improvement.

Another troubling trend is **dunking** on the ""*Hindi heartland*"" or those who are uneducated or easily manipulated (*bhakts*). We **mock** them for fake news and religious fanaticism but do nothing to counter it.

Let's look at where we can take responsibility:

**1. Bhakts and Biased Media:**
- Have we challenged **propaganda** by sharing unbiased news articles?
- Have we spoken to our friends and direct families on important issues and ongoing developments?
- Have we asked our known people to move away from traditional media to those that are less biased?
- Have we tried to educate them without being aggressive or arguing?

**2.BJP:** Look Honestly, there is no regard for Basic constitutional values and principles. Zero.

**BJP** is way too arrogant to listen to us public. They don't give a damn about protests (Wrestlers/Farmers/Ladakh) and go ahead with things by hook or crook. Heck, our PM won't even attend parliament and the incumbent govt doesn’t even listen to opposition, they just dismiss them and throw them out, pass bills, use money bills to bypass Rajya Sabha scrutiny and what not.

So will BJP listen to us? Highly Unlikely.

But should we not voice our opinion and demands? Trying is better than not trying.

I’ll talk about how we can voice our opinions and concerns effectively without endangering anyone of us.

**3.Opposition:**

We blame them for doing **appeasement politics**, for their regressive policies like uplifting **50% reservation**, like caste census, etc., or poor economic policies and more of socialism, among many others.

Have we told them look we will vote for you if you do XYZ?

Heck, we haven't told any party whether BJP or Congress what we need.

It's rather the other way around, these parties tell what they want to do and we have to vote and choose their plans. It's their plan/agenda and not ours.

**Solution?**

The first step would be to communicate both with the parties and the public.

**1.Communicating with the Public:** In my previous post, I discussed the importance of informing the public and empowering them to make informed choices. I proposed sharing a well-researched unbiased factual document – think of it as a citizen's guide – through various channels.

This could be on WhatsApp groups, social media platforms with **THOSE WE TRUST**, or even in casual conversations with friends, colleagues, or even those you interact with daily like your security guard or domestic help.

The key here is discretion. We want to reach as many people as possible, but there are risks to it. You may lose your job or get trashed. So only with those who you trust... could be as little as two friends and then they, in turn, share it with their friends.

The document itself should be objective, presenting unbiased facts and potential future scenarios based on each party's platform and principles. This will encourage critical thinking/introspection and help people envision the kind of India they want to build.

**2.Communicating with Political Parties:**

Let's draft a document outlining the demands of a progressive India. Gather millions of signatures on a platform like **Change.org**.

**Specific Demands, Measurable Outcomes:**
- Establish a Ministry of Foreign Investments to attract capital.
- Expand metro rail networks in major cities by xyz kms.
- Create a substantial startup fund of xyz crores.
- Open 5 new IITs and IIMs yearly.
- Increase forest cover by planting 1 Lakh trees yearly and have independent audits by experts.
- Increase press freedom to a specific ranking by a set date.
- Enforce stricter penalties for public littering and spitting.
- Prime minister should hold a press briefing every day (whenever present in India) for 10 minutes, Like it happens in the USA wrt President.

Politicians crave votes. If we can show them a large, engaged citizenry with specific demands, they will listen, at least to a few demands and that is still a victory in itself.

**Blaming others and giving up is not the answer. We, the citizens, must take responsibility for the health of our democracy.**

As Andy Dufresne said in Shawshank Redemption, ""**Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies**.""

Let's hold onto hope and try to work together to chart a better future.


Edit 1 : Those who feel we are already late to change things. Yes I agree with you 100%. 
But better late than never. We as citizens need to up our game and even if we change a few things and achieve in whatever short period we have. Its a win-win.

We can draft 1) unbiased Letter to share amongst our trusted people 2) draft a citizens manifesto and charter , get it widely circulated and surely some independent media channels will promote it.

We need to try before we know if we will fail or succeed. Thank you

Edit 2: Here’s the link to the document where we can collaborate: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mBwdAYH0vFcFAS23OyhiL-J3NRBl4FevNzI0nfF-9k/edit",452,99,2024-03-24,Julius_seizure_2k23,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1bmf1af/dont_blame_bjp_dont_blame_opposition_dont_blame/,dont

india,all,Reading recent news events makes me think that India is following in Russia's footsteps.,"When India got its independence in 1947, it had to decide how to run the country. It could follow the west or it could follow Russia. They were the only two world powers at that time. There were several problems with the West at that time. 

1. Capitalism seemed like a wonderful system back then. Tons of sky scrappers built in big cities like New York, etc. in the 1920s made it seem like it was the best form of government. But it was during this time that a lot of people were being overworked to death in a few giant corporations like Standard Oil, Vanderbilt's steel companies, etc. America was engaging in a lot of union busting activities just like today. People were underpaid. People were forced to work in Hazardous working conditions. And people were not allowed to unionize.
2. The multiparty system in the west was leading to policy paralysis. Companies were using this as an opportunity to buy off politicians. Politicians were jumping from one party to another to serve their own goals.  


This was the time when Russia was experimenting with this fancy new form of government called Communism. India couldn't adopt Communism completely, because it was a new and largely untested idea.   


Given all of this, India did the smart thing back then. It choose to be a third-world country neither aligning completely with the west nor aligning with Russia. To people who don't know, the phrase ""third-world country"" is not an insult. It just means a country that has not aligned with any bloc. Switzerland is a third-world country for example.  


Unfortunately for India though, it adopted the worst aspects of both forms of government. It had a multiparty system of governance inspired by the west. We had coalition governments last in the center for barely months sometimes. Every party's agenda was to block the other party's agenda. These political parties were using public funds to buy off politicians(eg BJP buying MLAs in Maharasthra).  


We also adopted the worst elements of communism too. We had a crap ton of public companies. From airlines, and car manufacturing companies to telecom companies the government was everywhere. The problem with public sector companies are:  
1. By nature, they don't strive for profit, they strive for public welfare. Which leads to a demand forecasting problem. They need to be able to predict how much of a commodity the public genuinely needs and produce that much exactly. This is not a solvable problem. We had these 5 years plans for these kinds of problems. Again this is something that was inspired by Russia. 

2. Public sector companies are prone to corruption. 

3. Government has to collect taxes to fund public sector companies. So if you like Maruti cars or not, you are going to pay for Maruti automobile's operational expenses. If Maruti automobiles need money for a venture it will come out of your tax money. If it makes a loss, your taxes will go up to make up for that loss. Even if you don't like cars and you don't even want to buy a car, you are still forced to pay for the expenses of a car manufacturing company. To people who don't know, Maruti was a public sector company till 2000s.  


There is a reason why our parents are so obsessed with Govt jobs. There is a reason why being an IAS officer was considered a dream job by our parents. 

Russia was facing a lot of these issues with public sector companies just like India. In India, we had this phrase called License Raj. The government had a sort of a death grip over the economy. When Russia collapsed in the 90s, it inevitably bankrupted India too. India had to fly over its gold to IMF and mortgage it to raise money to pay off its debts. One of the conditions that the IMF imposed on India was that India had to open up its markets. There were large-scale reforms undertaken by India back then. Manmohan Singh who gets trolled for being silent was the finance minister back then. He architected these reforms. This actually did wonderful things for India. Most of us Millenials in India would have heard our parents complain that they had no money in the 70s and 80s, this is because of License Raj. The government basically choked the Economy to death.   


Now after the 90s, Russia started selling off all of its public sector companies. Just like the way our government is trying to sell off/sold off Air India, BALCO, Hindustan Zinc, VSNL etc. Now Russia did not sell off its government assets properly. Boris Yeltsin was a drunk, he sold off most of the government assets to his rich friends the Russian Oligarchs. Assets that were funded by public money fell into the hands of a few rich people. Poor people in Russia continued to be poor. The rich continued to be rich. The idea to sell these government assets was the right one, albeit the execution was flawed.   


Today there are talks of investing more money into BSNL. People are saying that we need to prop it up, so it becomes a viable competitor to Reliance Jio and Airtel. Let's be honest, that shit's not going to happen. We the taxpayers would have to spend 10 rupees on BSNL for it to create a 1 rupee value. Rather than setting up regulations to control Reliance & Airtel, we are wasting our hard-earned money on a failing enterprise like BSNL. A couple of years down the line, they will sell it to our dear Indian Oligarchs Ambani, Adani, Tata, and Birla anyways for a fraction of the money, that we the taxpayers spent on it.   


Today there are talks of raising money via taxes. GST on curd, paneer, and whatnot.  I say it is a good idea. Except for salaried employees in India, the majority don't pay taxes. If you are selling land or buying land, one of the things that are usually discussed is the ratio of white money to black money. India needs tax money to pay for its social welfare schemes and large-scale much-needed infrastructure projects. But I don't think the additional money the government is collecting via GST will go towards any social welfare scheme or building bridges or anything. It will be spent on keeping BSNL afloat till the day Ambani/Adani decides to buy it.",0,1,2022-07-28,throwback656,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/wa4cxw/reading_recent_news_events_makes_me_think_that/,reading recent news events makes me think that india is following in russias footsteps,when india got its independence in it had to decide how to run the country it could follow the west or it could follow russia they were the only two world powers at that time there were several problems with the west at that time capitalism seemed like a wonderful system back then tons of sky scrappers built in big cities like new york etc in the s made it seem like it was the best form of government but it was during this time that a lot of people were being overworked to death in a few giant corporations like standard oil vanderbilts steel companies etc america was engaging in a lot of union busting activities just like today people were underpaid people were forced to work in hazardous working conditions and people were not allowed to unionize the multiparty system in the west was leading to policy paralysis companies were using this as an opportunity to buy off politicians politicians were jumping from one party to another to serve their own goals this was the time when russia was experimenting with this fancy new form of government called communism india couldnt adopt communism completely because it was a new and largely untested idea given all of this india did the smart thing back then it choose to be a thirdworld country neither aligning completely with the west nor aligning with russia to people who dont know the phrase thirdworld country is not an insult it just means a country that has not aligned with any bloc switzerland is a thirdworld country for example unfortunately for india though it adopted the worst aspects of both forms of government it had a multiparty system of governance inspired by the west we had coalition governments last in the center for barely months sometimes every partys agenda was to block the other partys agenda these political parties were using public funds to buy off politicianseg bjp buying mlas in maharasthra we also adopted the worst elements of communism too we had a crap ton of public companies from airlines and car manufacturing companies to telecom companies the government was everywhere the problem with public sector companies are by nature they dont strive for profit they strive for public welfare which leads to a demand forecasting problem they need to be able to predict how much of a commodity the public genuinely needs and produce that much exactly this is not a solvable problem we had these years plans for these kinds of problems again this is something that was inspired by russia public sector companies are prone to corruption government has to collect taxes to fund public sector companies so if you like maruti cars or not you are going to pay for maruti automobiles operational expenses if maruti automobiles need money for a venture it will come out of your tax money if it makes a loss your taxes will go up to make up for that loss even if you dont like cars and you dont even want to buy a car you are still forced to pay for the expenses of a car manufacturing company to people who dont know maruti was a public sector company till s there is a reason why our parents are so obsessed with govt jobs there is a reason why being an ias officer was considered a dream job by our parents russia was facing a lot of these issues with public sector companies just like india in india we had this phrase called license raj the government had a sort of a death grip over the economy when russia collapsed in the s it inevitably bankrupted india too india had to fly over its gold to imf and mortgage it to raise money to pay off its debts one of the conditions that the imf imposed on india was that india had to open up its markets there were largescale reforms undertaken by india back then manmohan singh who gets trolled for being silent was the finance minister back then he architected these reforms this actually did wonderful things for india most of us millenials in india would have heard our parents complain that they had no money in the s and s this is because of license raj the government basically choked the economy to death now after the s russia started selling off all of its public sector companies just like the way our

india,all,Supreme court is taking Modi to cleaners. Follow the LiveLaw handle.,"Looks like the new CJI has a spine. The SC bench has made some very pertinent and sharp observations like allowing Indian generic companies to manufacture vaccines etc. Hopefully, something good will come out of this.

Key pointers -

1. The bench asks if the Centre has considered using the powers under Section 92 of Patents Act for compulsory licensing of the COVID vaccines.
2. The bench asks the Central Government why it is not buying 100 percentage of COVID vaccine doses as it is in a better place best place to determine equity and disburse.  Why cannot the Centre follow the national immunization program policy with respect to COVID vaccines, SC asks.
3. Has the centre considered to invoking section 92 of patents act and issue compulsory licenses so that drugs can be manufactured while royalty is sorted? Supreme Court asks Centre.
4. Supreme Court asks why should the court not issue directions under Section 100 and Section 92 of Patents Act to enable generics to manufacture [\#COVID](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID?src=hashtag_click) drugs without the fear of legal action?
5. Supreme Court flags the issue of threat of coercive action against people putting SOS calls on social media. ""We want to make it very clear that if citizens communicate their grievance on social media and internet then it cannot be said its wrong information"", SC says.
6. ""We don't want any clampdown of information. We will treat it as a contempt of court if such grievances is considered for action.  Let a strong message go to all the states and DGP of states"", Supreme Court says in strong words.
7. Justice Chandrachud reiterates that a ""national immunization policy"" must be followed. He flags concerns about exclusion of SC/STs, disenfranchised from vaccination coverage. 
8. Supreme Court tells Centre not to leave vaccine pricing to the manufacturers.  ""Dont leave it to the manufacturers. How will they determine equity?. Invoke your powers to see that additional facilities are created for vaccine manufacturing"", Justice Chandrachud tells SG.

india,all,Read this article about Thailand. It make me think about a few things in India,"I just read a very eye-opening article, 

[What I learnt bootstrapping my startup from Thailand for six months](http://levels.io/bootstrapping-startup-thailand/)

Every competitive advantage that he states for Thailand can be had in India, with a little effort


- Purchasing power of western currencies

- Comfortable accomodation for cheap

- Cheap food and domestic services

- Available domestic skill pool

Yet, no foreigners come here to innovate, there is virtually no industry which imports foreign skill which is willing to work here. I don't even need to spell out the advantages everyone will have with this. On the contrary, skill is leaving the country in hordes.

Instead, what we have is the following:

- FII. Good but not so useful. Basically speculative and arbitrage hungry flow of money. Provides some liquidity and credit, but short term and fair-weather.

- FDI. Good, but at the present there are policy bottlenecks and I see only limited scope of technology and skill transfer.

- SEZ. Mindless re-implementation of Chinese model. Whereas you can count the Chinese ones in your fingers there are more than 300 pipelined in India. None of these has come to much fruition.

- IT parks/Biotech Parks, etc. Tied to universities, have failed to attract a lot of attention from my perspective. (Edit: to explain, I think most Indian universities are substandard compared even lower middle US universities.)

- BPOs. Ok but not really the stuff that builds the backbone of an economy.



I think instead of going for zonal tax/industry enclosures, we should concentrate on building sufficient infrastructure to attract and recall lost talent. 

If our villages have pucca roads, working electricity, plumbing, effective Law and Order, and a few shops and good connectivity to urban centres, we can also declog our cities. 

I am sure many people would be willing to move out of our shitholes, breathe clean air and have large spacious open spaces to roam around and live nicely with their families in. 

The only reason I don't move to a peaceful clean air village

- Afraid that local goons would rob my house and kill my family

- No assurance of water, electricity, internet

- Shitty PHCs with unwilling or absentee doctors and untrained staff

- Shitty schools where my future children would have not future.

- Shitty roads, have to make a back breaking ride to the city for supplies, etc.

## tl;dr

The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (the “Intermediary Rules”) fundamentally change the way the internet will be experienced in India. We provide you with an overview of its contents, the “safeguards” it seeks to establish, how they affect your internet usage experience, and your fundamental rights. Most notably, the Rules now will bring government control rather than regulation over digital news platforms and OTT video content providers. Several requirements under them suffer from unconstitutionality and undermine the free expression and privacy for millions of internet users in India.

## What are the Intermediary Rules?

In our [**previous post**](https://internetfreedom.in/latest-draft-intermediary-rules-fixing-big-tech-by-breaking-our-digital-rights/), we discussed the sketchy history of the Intermediary Rules. We also touched upon an analysis of the draft version, and while there have been some changes between the finalised version, the core of the proposals remain. They massively undermine your privacy and free expression as users of the Internet in India. For a quick explainer on what they are, you can also view a video we made yesterday.

Yesterday evening these rules were notified in the [**official gazette**](http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2021/225464.pdf) as the “Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021”. For convenience, let’s just call them the Intermediary Rules. The Intermediary Rules have replaced[ **the Information Technology (Intermediaries guidelines) Rules, 2011**](https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/GSR314E_10511%281%29_0.pdf) (or the 2011 Rules). In this post, we bring a much more in-depth and legal analysis of the Intermediary Rules breaking down the top 5 changes in each chapter that impact your digital rights.

## What is the structure of the Intermediary Rules?

While Part I of the Intermediary Rules mainly lays down the definitions of terms, Part II and Part III contain the actual compliances and requirements. Part II deals with the regulation of intermediaries, including social media intermediaries. Social media intermediaries include messaging-related intermediaries, such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, and media-related intermediaries, such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. This part is administered by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).

Part III deals with the regulation of digital news media (though there is a lack of clarity on exactly which news media these Rules apply to) and OTT platforms, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+Hotstar. Part III is administered by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.

Below we are doing a deeper dive and an initial analysis of the new compliances with brief comments on possible impacts. We invite you to use the comments feature to let us know your thoughts, views, and yes, we do remain open to any and all corrections. We intend to advance a public discussion on these massive changes to our internet freedom which appear to hurt our privacy and free expression tremendously.

### Social media and messaging related intermediaries

**1. Creation of differential obligations:** Fresh classes have been created including, “social media intermediary” \[Rule 2(w)\] and “significant social media intermediary” \[Rule 2(v)\]. The threshold for social media intermediary to be considered and regulated as a “significant social media intermediary” was notified on February 26, 2021, as fifty lakh (5 million) registered users. These categories bring a high level of government discretion in determining which platforms need to comply with what regulations. Such power is further reinforced by Rule 6, as per which the government may, by order, require \*any intermediary\* to comply with obligations imposed on a “significant social media intermediary” under Rule 4. To do so, it must satisfy the threshold of “a material risk of harm”. This threshold is vague, and it enables the Central Government to enforce discriminatory compliances.

**2. Nanny requirement:** Do you hate email spam? Do you hate incomprehensible Terms of Service and Privacy Policies even more? Well, get ready for them being delivered more than once a year. Under the new rules, each intermediary will have to notify you at least each year \[Rule 3(c)\]. This means practically a whole host of web services will send you periodic emails reminding you not to do anything “illegal”, or they will terminate your account.

**3. Grievance redressal mechanism:** While in the [**version in 2011**](https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/GSR314E_10511%281%29_0.pdf), an intermediary was required to appoint a grievance redressal officer (Rule 11), there are a whole host of compliances now necessary that have been additionally placed. Previously, the Grievance Officer was responsible for receiving complaints from users concerning the Rules and redressing them within a month. Now, the Grievance Officer is responsible for acknowledging complaints within 24 hours and resolving them within a reduced timeline of 15 days \[Rule 3(2)(a)(i)\]. The Grievance Officer has also been made responsible for the receipt and acknowledgement of any order, notice or direction issued by the appropriate government, any competent authority or a court of competent jurisdiction \[Rule 3(2)(a)(ii)\]. However, grievance officers for intermediaries other than significant social media intermediaries are not required to furnish reasons for the decision taken regarding complaints received by them. They don’t have to furnish reasons either to the complainant or even to the user whose content may have been removed because of the Intermediary Rules. This is discussed in more detail below.

**4. Significant Social Media Intermediaries get a full grievance redressal team:** In addition to the obligations imposed on intermediaries, significant social media intermediaries, which is a distinct class, have an additional requirement to appoint three officers with different responsibilities \[Rule 4(1)\]. The officers are:

* a Chief Compliance Officer, responsible for ensuring compliance with the Information Technology Act, 2000 (the IT Act) and the rules made thereunder, and liable for proceedings in this regard;
* a nodal person of contact, for “24x7 coordination” with law enforcement agencies; and
* a Resident Grievance Officer, with similar responsibilities as the Grievance Officer for intermediaries described above.

A Resident Grievance Officer of a significant social media intermediary is also required to notify a user before removing content posted by such user with reasons, provide them with an opportunity to dispute such action, and give the complainant its reasons for the decision taken in response to their complaint \[Rules 4(6)\]and 4(8)\]. Notably, the grievance officers for other intermediaries do not have such requirements.

All three officers appointed by the significant social media intermediaries, as above, are now legally required to reside in India. Significant social media Intermediaries are also required to have a physical contact address in India \[Rule 4(5)\]. Officer’s details and the physical contact address must be prominently published on its website or mobile-based Internet application. It is important to note that the Home Ministry has [**fortnightly meetings**](https://www.indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/home-ministry-fake-news-meeting-whatsapp-twitter-facebook-google-1393676-2018-11-22) with all social media entities in India. We may expect this list to grow now, with designated Chief Compliance Officers required to attend them.

**5. Contracted timelines for assistance to law enforcement agencies**: The obligation on the intermediaries in the 2011 Rules was to “act within thirty-six hours and where applicable, work with the user or owner of such information” to take it down. Under the new Intermediaries Rules, intermediaries must \*complete\* the takedown process under Section 79(3) of the [**IT Act**](https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/itbill2000.pdf), within 36 hours. Further, the 2011 Rules did not specify a timeline within which intermediaries were required to provide information or assistance to law enforcement agencies. The Intermediary Rules have provided intermediaries with a 72-hour limit for providing such information or assistance \[Rule 3(2)(j)\]. Additionally, a new takedown requirement has been added, wherein specific scenarios, such as nudity, depiction of sexual conduct or impersonation, the intermediary is required to take down such content, upon request of the concerned user, within 24 hours \[Rule 3(2)(b)\].  

**6.** **Hello big brother! Expansion of mandatory data retention:** The data retention period has been doubled, and intermediaries are now required to preserve information for 180 days (6 months!) for investigative purposes \[Rule 3(1)(h)\]. The data has to be preserved even after a user has deleted their accounts. It is important to consider this requirement in the absence of a data protection law and any kind of oversight on how surveillance operates in India (side note: IFF is a litigant challenging it in the Supreme Court).

**7.** **“Voluntary” verification of social media users:** Significant social media Intermediaries must also allow their users to “voluntarily” verify their accounts, using any appropriate mechanism, including the active Indian mobile number of the user. The significant social media intermediary shall also provide a visible and demonstrable mark identifying such verification \[Rule 4(7)\]. This could lead to a scenario where the voluntary becomes mandatory, as is the case with many other technologies which were introduced as “voluntary” but eventually made mandatory in an indirect manner. It would then have severe implications for anonymity and privacy (*imagine being made to link your Aadhaar to your social media accounts without which government handles may not respond to you!*), which are essential for users of social media intermediaries, for example, political dissenters. Also, much more worryingly, without a data protection law, this means that Social Media entities will collect data of our government IDs without any regulatory body, such as a data protection authority, to ensure it is used only for verification.

**8. An end to end-to-end encryption**: Significant social media intermediaries must enable tracing of the originator of information on their platform if required by a court of competent jurisdiction or a competent authority under Section 69A of the IT Act \[Rule 4(2)\]. While the Intermediaries Rules clarify that traceability order may only be passed for serious offences, some categories are open-ended. For instance, “public order” grounds are relatively broad in operation and can give rise to many demands. The Intermediaries Rules also clarify that in doing so, the significant social media intermediary shall not be required to disclose the contents of any electronic message, any other information related to the first originator, or any information related to its other users. However, the [**Information Technology Decryption Rules**](https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Information%20Technology%20%28Procedure%20and%20Safeguards%20for%20Interception%2C%20Monitoring%20and%20Decryption%20of%20Information%29%20Rules%2C%202009.pdf) contain powers to make demands for the message content. Used together, the government will break any type of end-to-end encryption to gain knowledge of who sent what message and also get to know its contents. Also, this specific requirement will break existing protocols for the deployment of end-to-end encryption that has been built through rigorous cybersecurity testing over the years!

**9.** **AI automated censorship:** Significant social media intermediaries are now also required to develop and deploy technology-based measures. These include automated tools or other mechanisms to proactively identify information that depicts any act or simulation in any form depicting rape, child sexual abuse or conduct \[Rule 4(4)\]. We have highlighted how even the best effort deployment of such filtering technologies (such as Photo DNA) can lead to function creeps. For instance, the Delhi Police has [**sought** ](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/social-networking/news/cbi-reportedly-asks-social-media-firms-to-use-intrusive-photodna-technology-to-track-suspects-1971042)for it to be used at least once in a criminal investigations entirely unconnected to rape or child sexual conduct.

**10.** **Penalty provisions:** The 2011 Rules did not specify any consequences upon the intermediaries for failing to comply with the provisions of the Rules; the consequence was relatively direct -- they lost immunity! The Intermediaries Rules, 2021 expressly state a loss of immunity and indicate a level of severity of consequences, including potential criminal prosecution under provisions of the IT Act and the Indian Penal Code \[Rule 7\].

### Digital News Media and Video Streaming Platforms

Arguably the most significant development in the Rules is the regulation of OTT platforms and digital news media when they use other intermediary sites/apps such as Twitter or Facebook and when they host news media content on their own website/app. It is worth mentioning that the 2011 Rules did not regulate Digital News Media and OTTs. Before going into the specifics, some comment on the larger framework and its legality.

**1. Power to administer conferred upon MI&B:** The Rules have been framed under the Information Technology Act, 2000, and as such, MeitY is the nodal ministry to administer these rules. However, as per the Intermediary Rules, Part III will be administered by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting \[Rule 8(1)\].

**2. Scope of regulation under the IT Act has been expanded:** Digital news media and OTT platforms were not previously regulated under the provisions of the IT Act. This was changed with a notification under the Business of Allocation Rules. But this notification only confers [**administrative clarity**](https://internetfreedom.in/statement-on-online-news-media-and-ott-platforms/) on which ministry gets to administer the sector. It does not create the power to exercise it. For this, a clear parliamentary enactment is necessary. However, instead of going to parliament, the Intermediary Rules framed under the IT Act seek to expand the scope of regulation under the purview of the IT Act to include digital news media and OTT platforms. This amounts to the executive amending parliamentary legislation and is not permissible under the Constitution.

**3. Excessive delegation of powers:** The Rules suffer from an excessive delegation of powers. As an example, the Rules have established a non-judicial adjudicatory process to resolve grievances regarding content published by Digital News Media and OTTs. They have also created an adjudicatory body which is the “oversight committee”. This is even though the IT Act does not specifically empower the Government to do so. This non-judicial adjudicatory process has been discussed in detail below.  


Apart from the above, the noteworthy aspects of this part have been discussed below.

**1.** **A broad sweep. Not only large digital news websites:** No threshold requirement of users or readership has been contemplated to differentiate between digital news media on the basis of size and scale, as has been done in Part II in the case of social media intermediaries and significant social media intermediaries. The Intermediaries Rules have been made applicable to all publishers of news and current affairs content, as long as they have a physical presence in India or conduct the systematic business activity of making their content available in India \[Rule 8(1)\]. Since ‘news and current affairs content‘ has been defined as “*newly received or noteworthy content, including analysis, especially about recent events primarily of socio-political, economic or cultural nature, made available over the internet or computer networks*” \[Rule 2(m)\], the Intermediaries Rules will arguably seek to regulate a large number of internet users that engage in producing similar content on a very small scale.

**2.** **Regulation of foreign news media:** While territorial presence is one of the requirements for digital news media to be regulated under the Intermediaries Rules, it is not a necessary condition \[Rule 8(2)\]. If a digital news media organisation makes its content available in India in a systematic and continued manner, the provisions of the Intermediaries Rules will apply to them. In the case of significant social media intermediaries, the Intermediaries Rules made it mandatory for them to establish a physical presence in India by appointing officers resident in India and providing an Indian address for correspondence; however, it is unclear how foreign news media organisations are sought to be regulated by Indian authorities.

**3.** **Code of Ethics:** Digital News Media and OTTs have to adhere to a Code of Ethics which has been laid down in the Appendix to the Rules. The criteria provided in the Code of Ethics are vague, overbroad and will have a chilling effect on the free speech of publishers, as well as the right to access information for consumers of content.

* **As applicable to Digital News Media:** Digital News Media has to comply with Norms of Journalistic Conduct of the Press Council of India and Programme Code, and ensure that content which is prohibited under any law is not published or transmitted  (Paragraph I of Appendix)
* **As applicable to OTTs:** This is important because OTTs have now been mandated to classify content based on the type of content as ‘U’, ‘U/A 7+’, ‘U/A 13+’, ‘U/A 16+’ and ‘A’ (Paragraph II(B) of Appendix). The OTTs have to ensure that the content which is classified as u/A13\+ or higher has access control measure and content classified as A (restricted to adults) has a reliable age verification mechanism for viewership of such content, in addition to access control measures to restrict minors from accessing such content (Paragraph II(C) and II(D) of Appendix).  Apart from this, the Code of Ethics also mandates OTTs to take into consideration India’s multi-racial and multi-religious context and ‘*exercise due caution and discretion’* while featuring activities, beliefs, practices, or views of any racial or religious groups. This is likely to have a chilling effect on speech as it provides formal validity to the concerns which have been raised by certain groups against artistic content.

**4.** **Grievance Redressal Mechanism:** To ensure observance of the Code of Ethics, the Intermediary Rules have introduced a three-tier mechanism. The Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting, at the [**press conference**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0eqWuj84-0) on February 25 2021, unveiling these Rules, touted the three tier mechanism as self-regulation by the publishers with minimal governmental interference. On a closer look, it is apparent that the Rules envisage much more than ‘minimal government interference’.

* **First Tier:** At the first level, similar to the requirement for intermediaries under Rule 3, digital news media and OTT platforms must establish a grievance redressal mechanism and appoint a Grievance Officer, resident in India. The Grievance Officer is required to take a decision on every grievance received by it within 15 days.If the complainant does not receive a satisfactory response within 15 days, they may appeal to Level II, i.e. the self-regulating body. (Rules 10 and 11)
* **Second Tier:** At the second level, the “self-regulating” body is to be an independent body constituted by publishers or their associations, and headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court, a High Court, or an independent eminent person from  media, broadcasting, entertainment, child rights, human rights or other relevant fields. This body must be registered with the MI&B, and the MI&B will “satisfy itself” that the self-regulating body has been constituted properly. The self-regulating body is empowered to warn/censure/admonish/reprimand the publisher, require an apology, reclassify ratings, or even censor the content as it deems fit. If the publisher fails to comply with the directions of the self-regulating body, the matter may be referred to the Central Government at the third tier. (Rule 12)
* **Third Tier:** Level III is the oversight mechanism for the self-regulation by digital news media and OTT platforms. The oversight mechanism is an “Inter-Departmental Committee”, consisting of representatives from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Law and Justice, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Defence, and such other Ministries and Organisations (Rule 14). The Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee will be a Joint Secretary of the MI&B \[Rule 13(2)\]. This Committee will hear complaints regarding decisions taken at Levels I and II, and is empowered to delete or modify content for preventing incitement to the commission of a cognisable offence relating to public order. \[Rule 14(5)\].  


**5.** **Encouraging self-censorship:** While publishers are expected to self-regulate at the first tier, the provisions of the Rules are too onerous for self-regulation to effectively be complied with. Any person is empowered to make a complaint with the publisher, and the publisher must respond within 15 days, or risk censure. In terms of what this means for the regular internet-user, digital news media will have to edit their coverage to keep in mind the arbitrary manner in which overbroad restrictions are applied, particularly when the news is not favourable to the government. Further, OTT platforms, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+Hotstar, will be forced to adhere to similar censorship norms as prevail in offline movies and television content.

**6.** **Excessive governmental control over digital news and OTT content:** While level II of the 3-tier mechanism is framed as the second layer of self-regulation, it is in fact the first layer of government control. The Chairman of the self-regulatory body is suggested to be a retired Judge of the High Court or Supreme Court, and even though the body is ostensibly expected to be appointed/elected by the media community, the MI&B retains approval power over the composition of the body.

**7.** **Executive exercise of judicial powers:** The oversight mechanism, consisting of the Inter-Departmental Committee comprises entirely of members of the executive, i.e. officers from various ministries, and is chaired by the Joint Secretary, Ministry Information and Broadcasting, who is in turn supervised by the Secretary, MI&B. This Inter-Departmental Committee is responsible for hearing complaints arising out of the three-tier grievance mechanism. In particular, when news or OTT content is sought to be deleted or modified, it is the Secretary, MI&B that is empowered to take such action, on recommendation from the Joint Secretary. So basically, an aggrieved person can escalate a complaint up to the government, or the Government can directly refer a complaint to this Inter-Departmental Committee.

**8. Emergency blocking powers:** The Intermediary Rules provide emergency powers to the MI&B in cases where “no delay is acceptable”. The Secretary may, if she/he is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient and justifiable issue directions for blocking of online content  to persons, publishers or intermediary in control of hosting such information, without giving them an opportunity of hearing. (Rule 16)

**9.** **Range of punitive measures:** The self-regulatory body of tier-II and the Inter-Departmental Committee of level-III have been provided wide-ranging punitive powers over digital news media and OTT platforms, including the power to empowered to warn/censure/admonish/reprimand the publisher, require a warning card or disclaimer, require an apology, reclassify ratings, or even censor the content as it deems fit and recommend action under Section 69A of the [**IT Act.**](https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/itbill2000.pdf)

**10.** **Registration with the government:** While taking questions from the press at the[ **press conference**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0eqWuj84-0), Union Minister Prakash Javadekar admitted that the government was not aware of who are the digital news media and OTT platforms. To rectify this information gap, the Intermediary Rules require digital news media and OTT platforms to furnish details of their entity and their accounts on intermediaries to the MI&B (Rules 5 and 18).

We are of the view that the Intermediaries Rules have far-reaching consequences on online privacy, freedom of speech and expression, and access to information, in addition to the constitutional issues that the Rules suffer from.

massive changes to our internet freedom which appear to hurt our privacy and free expression tremendously social media and messaging related intermediaries creation of differential obligations fresh classes have been created including social media intermediary rule w and significant social media intermediary rule v the threshold for social media intermediary to be considered and regulated as a significant social media intermediary was notified on february as fifty lakh million registered users these categories bring a high level of government discretion in determining which platforms need to comply with what regulations such power is further reinforced by rule as per which the government may by order require any intermediary to comply with obligations imposed on a significant social media intermediary under rule to do so it must satisfy the threshold of a material risk of harm this threshold is vague and it enables the central government to enforce discriminatory compliances nanny requirement do you hate email spam do you hate incomprehensible terms of service and privacy policies even more well get ready for them being delivered more than once a year under the new rules each intermediary will have to notify you at least each year rule c this means practically a whole host of web services will send you periodic emails reminding you not to do anything illegal or they will terminate your account grievance redressal mechanism while in the version in an intermediary was required to appoint a grievance redressal officer rule there are a whole host of compliances now necessary that have been additionally placed previously the grievance officer was responsible for receiving complaints from users concerning the rules and redressing them within a month now the grievance officer is responsible for acknowledging complaints within hours and resolving them within a reduced timeline of days rule ai the grievance officer has also been made responsible for the receipt and acknowledgement of any order notice or direction issued by the appropriate government any competent authority or a court of competent jurisdiction rule aii however grievance officers for intermediaries other than significant social media intermediaries are not required to furnish reasons for the decision taken regarding complaints received by them they dont have to furnish reasons either to the complainant or even to the user whose content may have been removed because of the intermediary rules this is discussed in more detail below significant social media intermediaries get a full grievance redressal team in addition to the obligations imposed on intermediaries significant social media intermediaries which is a distinct class have an additional requirement to appoint three officers with different responsibilities rule the officers are a chief compliance officer responsible for ensuring compliance with the information technology act the it act and the rules made thereunder and liable for proceedings in this regard a nodal person of contact for x coordination with law enforcement agencies and a resident grievance officer with similar responsibilities as the grievance officer for intermediaries described above a resident grievance officer of a significant social media intermediary is also required to notify a user before removing content posted by such user with reasons provide them with an opportunity to dispute such action and give the complainant its reasons for the decision taken in response to their complaint rules and notably the grievance officers for other intermediaries do not have such requirements all three officers appointed by the significant social media intermediaries as above are now legally required to reside in india significant social media intermediaries are also required to have a physical contact address in india rule officers details and the physical contact address must be prominently published on its website or mobilebased internet application it is important to note that the home ministry has fortnightly meetings with all social media entities in india we may expect this list to grow now with designated chief compliance officers required to attend them contracted timelines for assistance to law enforcement agencies the obligation on the intermediaries in the rules was to act within thirtysix hours and where applicable work with the user or owner of such information to take it down under the new intermediaries rules intermediaries must complete the takedown process under section of the it act within hours further the rules did not specify a timeline within which intermediaries were required to provide information or assistance to law enforcement agencies the intermediary rules have provided intermediaries with a hour limit for providing such information or assistance rule j additionally a new takedown requirement has been added wherein specific scenarios such as nudity depiction of sexual conduct or impersonation the intermediary is required to take down such content upon request of the concerned user within hours rule b hello big brother expansion of mandatory data retention the data retention period has been doubled and intermediaries are now required to preserve information for days months for investigative purposes rule h the data has to be preserved even after a user has deleted their accounts it is important to consider this requirement in the absence of a data protection law and any kind of oversight on how surveillance operates in india side note iff is a litigant challenging it in the supreme court voluntary verification of social media users significant social media intermediaries must also allow their users to voluntarily verify their accounts using any appropriate mechanism including the active indian mobile number of the user the significant social media intermediary shall also provide a visible and demonstrable mark identifying such verification rule this could lead to a scenario where the voluntary becomes mandatory as is the case with many other technologies which were introduced as voluntary but eventually made mandatory in an indirect manner it would then have severe implications for anonymity and privacy imagine being made to link your aadhaar to your social media accounts without which government handles may not respond to you which are essential for users of social media intermediaries for example political dissenters also much more worryingly without a data protection law this means that social media entities will collect data of our government ids without any regulatory body such as a data protection authority to ensure it is used only for verification an end to endtoend encryption significant social media intermediaries must enable tracing of the originator of information on their platform if required by a court of competent jurisdiction or a competent authority under section a of the it act rule while the intermediaries rules clarify that traceability order may only be passed for serious offences some categories are openended for instance public order grounds are relatively broad in operation and can give rise to many demands the intermediaries rules also clarify that in doing so the significant social media intermediary shall not be required to disclose the contents of any electronic message any other information related to the first originator or any information related to its other users however the information technology decryption rules contain powers to make demands for the message content used together the government will break any type of endtoend encryption to gain knowledge of who sent what message and also get to know its contents also this specific requirement will break existing protocols for the deployment of endtoend encryption that has been built through rigorous cybersecurity testing over the years ai automated censorship significant social media intermediaries are now also required to develop and deploy technologybased measures these include automated tools or other mechanisms to proactively identify information that depicts any act or simulation in any form depicting rape child sexual abuse or conduct rule we have highlighted how even the best effort deployment of such filtering technologies such as photo dna can lead to function creeps for instance the delhi police has sought it to be used at least once in a criminal investigations entirely unconnected to rape or child sexual conduct penalty provisions the rules did not specify any consequences upon the intermediaries for failing to comply with the provisions of the rules the consequence was relatively direct they lost immunity the intermediaries rules expressly state a loss of immunity and indicate a level of severity of consequences including potential criminal prosecution under provisions of the it act and the indian penal code rule digital news media and video streaming platforms arguably the most significant development in the rules is the regulation of ott platforms and digital news media when they use other intermediary sitesapps such as twitter or facebook and when they host news media content on their own websiteapp it is worth mentioning that the rules did not regulate digital news media and otts before going into the specifics some comment on the larger framework and its legality power to administer conferred upon mib the rules have been framed under the information technology act and as such meity is the nodal ministry to administer these rules however as per the intermediary rules part iii will be administered by the ministry of information and broadcasting rule scope of regulation under the it act has been expanded digital news media and ott platforms were not previously regulated under the provisions of the it act this was changed with a notification under the business of allocation rules but this notification only confers administrative clarity on which ministry gets to administer the sector it does not create the power to exercise it for this a clear parliamentary enactment is necessary however instead of going to parliament the intermediary rules framed under the it act seek to expand the scope of regulation under the purview of the it act to include digital news media and ott platforms this amounts to the executive amending parliamentary legislation and is not permissible under the constitution excessive delegation of powers the rules suffer from an excessive delegation of powers as an example the rules have established a nonjudicial adjudicatory process to resolve grievances regarding content published by digital news media and otts they have also created an adjudicatory body which is the oversight committee this is even though the it act does not specifically empower the government to do so this nonjudicial adjudicatory process has been discussed in detail below apart from the above

economic or cultural nature made available over the internet or computer networks rule m the intermediaries rules will arguably seek to regulate a large number of internet users that engage in producing similar content on a very small scale regulation of foreign news media while territorial presence is one of the requirements for digital news media to be regulated under the intermediaries rules it is not a necessary condition rule if a digital news media organisation makes its content available in india in a systematic and continued manner the provisions of the intermediaries rules will apply to them in the case of significant social media intermediaries the intermediaries rules made it mandatory for them to establish a physical presence in india by appointing officers resident in india and providing an indian address for correspondence however it is unclear how foreign news media organisations are sought to be regulated by indian authorities code of ethics digital news media and otts have to adhere to a code of ethics which has been laid down in the appendix to the rules the criteria provided in the code of ethics are vague overbroad and will have a chilling effect on the free speech of publishers as well as the right to access information for consumers of content as applicable to digital news media digital news media has to comply with norms of journalistic conduct of the press council of india and programme code and ensure that content which is prohibited under any law is not published or transmitted paragraph i of appendix as applicable to otts this is important because otts have now been mandated to classify content based on the type of content as u ua ua ua and a paragraph iib of appendix the otts have to ensure that the content which is classified as ua or higher has access control measure and content classified as a restricted to adults has a reliable age verification mechanism for viewership of such content in addition to access control measures to restrict minors from accessing such content paragraph iic and iid of appendix apart from this the code of ethics also mandates otts to take into consideration indias multiracial and multireligious context and exercise due caution and discretion while featuring activities beliefs practices or views of any racial or religious groups this is likely to have a chilling effect on speech as it provides formal validity to the concerns which have been raised by certain groups against artistic content grievance redressal mechanism to ensure observance of the code of ethics the

Earlier Pakistan was used against India. Now India will be used against China. India is a founding member of the Non-alignment Movement(NAM).

If you were given the responsibility to make a decision to stay with the NAM or to deviate from it and take sides against China or any other country. What would you do? Go against China or stay away from the cold war that is simmering on the horizon?

india,all,Gift yourself some privacy. You will love it.,"From your mobile, send SMS to 1909

    START 0
This will register you for DND (Do Not Disturb) and block all telemarketers. Alternatively, you can call 1909 and use the IVRS, to register for DND.

The next time a telemarketer calls you or sends you an SMS about offering a personal loan or insurance policy or sales in a store, they you can first ask, 
""Where did you get my number from?"" Their template answer is ""Sir/Madam, we got it from our database""

Reply to them ""Thank you for your call and for sharing your full details with me. You are now on my database. I will report your number to TRAI and get your number disconnected within 7 days. Thanks again. Have a great day""

This is what you do afterward: Send an SMS to 1909 within 3 days of getting a call or SMS from the telemarketer.

    <Details of promotion>, <Sender ID / Number>, <DD/MM/YY>
Send to 1909

Examples:

    insurance, VK-SHARKN, 05/09/17

    personal loan, 9856321475, 04/09/17

Your service provider HAS to report these to TRAI.
You will get SMS confirmation from your telecom service provider with an SR number and ETA for resolution.
As per rules, your network operator has to report your SR number to TRAI. TRAI will take action on the telemarketer via his network provider.

Example:

    Hello! Thank you for interacting with Vodafone. Your service registration number is 2215647158. Your query shall be responded by Thursday  14-Sep-17 12:28p.m.

**Gift yourself some privacy. You will love it.**

And yes, the next time you buy something at a store, don't give out your mobile number.
Your privacy is worth more than a 5% discount on your next purchase at your favourite store.

Edit 1:
Basic phone is for family, banking and healthcare.
For all other junk activities: smartphone.

Edit 2:
This is for those who are suggesting installation of apps on your smartphone to block spam calls and SMS.
Have you checked the required permissions on such apps? You want to block telemarketers, but you are OK with an app getting access to the same data (and more) and routing it to any server, while you are blissfully unaware?

If you still wish to install an app, use TRAI DND
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=trai.gov.in.dnd
It is rated 2 * and uses a Gmail ID as support email.

*Well, it's slightly complicated in that the operators fine the party from where they received (usually a bulk SMS gateway provider) and they then try finding / fining the marketer responsible for this. The marketer may say buzz off and switch to another bulk sms provider, but then this can be done only so many times before you get blacklisted. It's not impossible but gets increasingly difficult to keep doing this when your SMS keep getting complaints.*

india,all,Jinhe Naaz Hai Hind Par Wo Kahan Hai? An Important Appeal,"Friends, **today our nation stands at a crossroads.** Unemployment, price rise, economic inequality, and corruption are at their peak. Attacks on Dalits, Adivasis, minorities and women are on a rise. Our nation is being thrown into the fire of communalism and hate for the political gains.

**Unemployment has become a national calamity.** The Modi government, which came to power with the promise of two crore jobs, has betrayed the youth. Permanent jobs are being privatized and contractualized. Regular employment is shrinking, while wages are declining in real terms. In 2019, the unemployment rate reached its highest level in 45 years. Today, the youth unemployment in India stands at 40%, while more than 30 lakh sanctioned government posts are lying vacant. Through the Agnipath scheme, the government has compromised the national security and the future of the youth. Youths who demand employment are being violently repressed.

**Government has pushed the farmers and workers in a terrible tragedy.** Rising unemployment, falling income and price rise has wreaked havoc on the workers. Public sector units are being privatized. The government, which came to power with the promise of minimum support price and doubling the income of farmers, has betrayed the farmers. Agricultural income has declined, and farmers are falling in debt and dying by suicide. In 2020, when the nation was under lockdown, the Government passed the anti-farmer laws in a conspiracy with the capitalists. In a struggle against this, 750 farmers lost their lives. Meanwhile, a violent persecution and propaganda against the farmers continues to this day.

**Economic inequality is at its peak.** The poor and middle class are facing the brunt of inflation, while the government is distributing lakhs of crores of loan waivers and tax cuts to the crony capitalists. In the last three years, while the nation was reeling under COVID pandemic and economic downturn, the number of billionaires in India increased from 102 to 169. Allegations of corruption and corporate fraud have been covered up, and those raising questions have been silenced. At the same time, domestic savings have fallen to its lowest level in five decades. Social security and senior citizen's concessions are being taken away. The price of essential household items, including oil and gas, have risen sharply. Meanwhile, hunger and malnutrition has pushed the country to 111th place out of 125 countries in the Global Hunger Index, with three-quarters of the population unable to afford a balanced-diet.

In the last 10 years, **there has been an unprecedented rise in hatred and violence** against Dalits, tribals, minorities and women. The Modi government has sheltered rapists in spite of widespread protests. BJP leaders have publicly made hate speeches and called for violence. BJP-led governments have encouraged, sponsored, and protected the rioters. Our religious festivals have been taken over by a political mob.

Affirmative action policies are being weakened. **Dalits, backward classes, and women are being deprived of their constitutional right to social justice.** Forest Law has been amended to facilitate corporate takeover of forests and drive the adivasis off their lands. Overriding environmental concerns and objections raised by environmentalists and scientists, the Government has pursued disastrous projects which has caused irreparable damage to the environment and the human life.

The BJP government has launched an assault against universities and academic institutions. Scientific and historical facts are being replaced with propaganda and falsehood. Government has openly promoted unscientific and irrational ideas. **Health and education budget have been slashed.**

**There has been an unprecedented assault on democracy and the Constitution.** Mainstream media has become the megaphone of the Government. Independent journalists are being persecuted. Any kind of protest or dissent is crushed with force. Fundamental rights are being trampled. Institutions like CBI, ED, Income Tax have been turned into a political weapon. The autonomy of the judiciary and the Election Commission is under a threat. Parliament has been turned into a rubber stamp of the Executive. Federalism is being weakened with interference and attacks against the state governments.

In 2016, the Modi government announced demonetization of banknotes with a four-hour notice. More than 100 people died in this man-made disaster. Everything, from small businesses to everyday life, was thrown into despair. During the COVID pandemic, without any regard for the common people, the government imposed nationwide lockdown at a four-hour notice. Lakhs of workers lost their livelihood and crores of people had to face starvation. Migrant workers had to walk thousands of kilometres on foot. **47 lakh people died of COVID due to the government's indifference.** Lakhs of people died without oxygen and hospital beds. Due to a lack of space in crematoriums, rivers began overflowing with dead bodies.

Generating 2 crore employment opportunities every year, making India a $5 trillion economy by 2024, building 100 smart cities by 2023, doubling the farmer's income by 2022, creating 10 crore new jobs in the manufacturing sector by 2022, bringing back the black money in 100 days, **every promise turned out to be a jumla.** Meanwhile, BJP received secret donations of over ₹6,500 crore through electoral bonds. Manipur is in a state of civil war. China has occupied thousands of square kilometres of Ladakh, and built roads and villages within the Indian border in Arunachal Pradesh.

To hide these failures, the Modi government is using religion as its refuge. Festivals and faith are being politicized. The public is being misled by spending crores of rupees on publicity. The reality of hunger, poverty, inflation, and unemployment is being hidden behind the curtain with an endless propaganda of ’Acche Din’ and ’Amrit Kaal’. **Instead of guaranteeing fair price to the farmers, employment to youth, security to women, social justice to backward classes, education, health, and prosperity to the citizens, and unity and brotherhood for the nation, the ruling party is talking about “Modi ki Guarantee”.** At the same time, efforts are being made to amend the Constitution and replace the democratic republic with an authoritarian state. A concerted attack on the values of our freedom struggle is underway.

Friends, **today our country is facing an unprecedented crisis.** The freedom, achieved through countless sacrifices and a long struggle, whose values are enshrined in our Constitution, is under a threat. The nation envisioned by Mahatma Gandhi, Maulana Azad, Babasaheb Ambedkar, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Shaheed Bhagat Singh, is under a planned assault.

The 2024 Lok Sabha election is the most important election in our nation's history. It is not merely an election between two coalitions. It is an election for our nation's destiny, for the values of our freedom struggle, for the survival of our democratic republic, for a new struggle and nation building. 2024 Lok Sabha elections is a “Do or Die” moment for our country. **It is our historic responsibility to reject the anti-people politics of BJP and ensure a crushing defeat of the Modi government in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.** Let us, we, the people of India, unite in this historic struggle and defeat the anti-people Modi

india,all,24 hours to Save Net Neutrality in India,"**THE DEADLINE HAS BEEN EXTENDED TILL 20th AUGUST SO PLEASE DO THE NEEDFUL**


The Government has called for Comments or Suggestions on Recommendations of Committee on Net Neutrality on MyGov.in . 

**AIB's latest video explains the latest development** - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0w_YhZUYeA&feature=youtu.be

**More from the SaveTheInternet Team** - http://blog.savetheinternet.in/24-hours-to-save-netneutrality-2/

**Alternatively You can go directly to MyGov and post your comments there** -  https://mygov.in/group-issue/give-your-comments-or-suggestions-recommendations-committee-net-neutrality/ 

**It takes 5 minutes**

You can use any of the following  templates as your comment. Please mix and match and add your own comments if you want and its not necessary to copy paste. 

**First Template -**

Net Neutrality means access to EVERYTHING without discrimination
Don't allow telecom operators to change the definition of Net Neutrality. Net Neutrality means access to EVERYTHING on the Internet, without discrimination. Not access to everyone. We want everyone to get access, but to all of the Internet. Don't allow creation of private walled gardens.


**Second Template** (Thanks [u/saptarsi](https://www.reddit.com/user/saptarsi) for this one)

No licensing of apps. No zero rating. No throttling/slowing down of websites/services. Equal access to all sites, apps. This is a must for Digital India.

**Third Template** (Thanks [u/juliancorrea](https://www.reddit.com/user/juliancorrea) for this one)

i want #netneutrality because i want to communicate with ""any human/machine ,any time without having to ask anyone’s permission "" net neutrality has huge implications on freedom of assembly and baking bias into policy will compromise national security in times of peril because monolithic data aggregation will result in pinpoint targets for attack . to distribute our population’s digital assets is a wise and prudent bet for the government and licenses hence make no sense for whatever reason


**Fourth Templates** (Thanks [u/atnixxin](https://www.reddit.com/user/atnixxin) for these other templates)

Government must act now

The DoT Report noted that a free and open Internet, available to all Indian citizens, is key to our country's future. Despite that, telcos are already violating net neutrality and endangering that future. The Govt should pass regulation immediately to protect net neutrality in India - the status quo of mere promises is not enough. The Govt must commit to protecting net neutrality in law in India. Don't take 5 years to decide this.

**Fifth Template**

Don’t allow Zero Rating

Zero rating allows large companies to act as gatekeepers of the Internet, and control which services Indians can access, must be prohibited. The DoT draft recommendations are too weak on this, and the Govt must take a strong stand to protect users.

**Sixth Template**

Don’t allow Zero Rating, not even on a case-by-case basis

Zero rating will encroach upon the bandwidth meant for the open Internet, decreasing its speed and increasing its price. The Govt should ensure that licensed spectrum is exclusively used to give open internet access to consumers, and not to sell consumers to big internet companies. There should be a complete ban on zero rating, not case-by-case approval.



**Seventh Template**

Don’t allow Zero Rating

Zero rating will enable well-funded Internet companies to purchase captive user bases, killing off smaller competitors and then increasing prices to recover the cost. It will decrease choice and harm consumers not only on the zero rating plans but also on the open Internet. The Govt should prohibit zero rating completely instead of giving approval on a case-by-case basis.

india,all,Opinion: Why BJP wont arrest their POCSO accused MP,"TLDR: Thakurs play a big part in BJPs UP prospects. Plus they are very fickle and will support which ever party gives them more power. In terms of numbers, BJP* won 41% of the vote in UP elections and SP* won 32.06%. Even if half of the Thakur vote (roughly 10% of the total UP vote) shifts back to SP, that would bring SP* and BJP* to even keel, making it doubly important to appease them.

While I would like to give my own opinions, I'm sharing some articles by jounalists who have put their thoughts much better than I think I can

>Jan 21 2022 :  Thakurs in Uttar Pradesh, despite being a powerful community that wields influence in urban and rural areas, has failed to find its voice in the corridors of power after the end of the Veer Bahadur Singh regime in 1988.

> Thakurs constitute only 8 per cent of the state's population but actually own around 50 per cent of the land. 

Read the whole article because it covers the caste arithmetic of the other UP parties, but here is the most important bit

> The opposition has even accused the Yogi government of going overboard in protecting Thakur interests and shielding Thakur criminals but the chief minister remains unapologetic about it.

https://www.deccanherald.com/election/uttar-pradesh/yogi-a-major-factor-in-thakur-support-for-bjp-1073184.html

The below article describes how SP used the Thakur vote to win big in 2002* and again in 2012 

> Mar 16, 2022 : In 2002, BJP supported the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Mayawati became the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. But her decision not to shield Kunda MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh (Raja Bhaiya) and Jaunpur MLA Dhananjay Singh from arrest irked the Kshatriya community.

> Their arrests triggered a revolt with as many as 40 Kshatriya MLAs of the UP Assembly, under the leadership of late Deoband MLA Rajender Singh Rana, extending outside support to the Samajwadi Party. This enabled the SP to form a government in UP with Mulayam Singh Yadav as chief minister.

>  Apr 19, 2019 : Since assuming power in 2017, the UP government led by Yogi Adityanath has been on a nomination spree of Thakurs in various institutional domains. Be it zilla parishad elections, SHO nominations, promotion of civil servants or of cops in particular, Thakurs have received a preferential treatment from the Yogi administration. Before the December 2018 elections, five out of seven BJP chief ministers in the Hindi belt were Thakurs.

> In UP, the Hindu Yuva Vahini, essentially a Thakur organisation Yogi Adityanath founded in 2002, has greatly expanded its reach and activities, filling the void in the criminal space left by gangsters who have been eliminated, arrested or driven out by the government's drastic encounter policy.

Edit:

Since the girls seem to have univocal support from the Jatt community, it is important to note that Jatts make up significant population in Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi and UP.

india,all,Ignore the huge influx of Pakistan during election season. Vote only for employment nothing else mattes in 2024,"Election is near and so are unnecessary mention of Pakistan every other post. Lets not get diverted and focus on making gov accountable for unemployment, future of unemployment with advancements in AI (private school teachers, most graduation courses, IT Engg) we are all on the verge of getting royally screwed. It doesn't matte if child in India utters AI after being born, that shit wont get him job or a stable future .

Unemployment will be the next corona we have to ensure, our ministers might not get new fortuner, crysta fleet this year but lets demand some concrete policies be it to force companies to give jobs or some compensation for laying off people like pigs. Universal basic income or some compensation. Relief in income tax

Since ""humari seema me naio koi ghusa hai"" lets cut money on buying weapons, Whats the point of protecting a county where 80% youths are unemployed or unemployable.

Vote for employment, its gonna be the next pandemic. US recession has been going for last 2year with not sign of stopping. We need our gov to step in and find ways to increase hiring across all sectors.

With unemployment crime rates are increasing in cities and it gonna get worse. Medical expenses /education expenses/ rent / property prices are through the roof and needs some check and balances.

Ignore all pakistan this and pakistan that (F\*\*K PAKISTAN) and make employment a issue

india,all,How to fix primary healthcare in India: A policy suggestion,"In recent years, a lot of Indians were able to lift themselves out of poverty. However, there are still millions of Indian households that are one serious medical expense away from dropping back into poverty. These people teeter on the edge.

One dysfunctional aspect of the Indian public healthcare system is that it is heavily tilted towards tertiary care rather than preventative care. Our political system rewards leaders who build flashy new hospitals rather than smaller primary care clinics (it seems AAP is an exception with its Mohalla clinics. However, I'm not sure if they will be rewarded politically for this). Clinics like this can catch many potentially ruinous (financially) diseases before they become unmanageable (physically and financially). India also needs to increase the budget allocation to healthcare but thats a discussion for another day. 

Even if a household goes to a government hospital, the medical expenses for things like TB or diabetes can push a family to extreme measures (selling family land, taking a loan from a money lender, pulling younger children out of school).

However, a lot of families could potentially save themselves from such ruinous expenses if there was early screening (primary care. think annual doctor visits).

Now, the problem here is, even if the clinics are free, how will you get the aam aadmi to visit them regularly (at least annually)? People, whether in India or in any other country do not behave in their rational interest. People tend to seek medical care too late into disease progression.

----------
I have a proposal that can take advantage of India's high religiousity. People visit their temples, mosques, gurudhwaras, and temples much more frequently than they visit a primary care physician.

What if the gov't set up primary care camps (blood tests, physicals, screenings, etc) at religious buildings (not year round, but during certain times of the year)?

For example, they can set up a camp in major mosques during the feasts after Eid, or in major temples during a major festival. 

People are more likely to attend a physical/screening if they are already on the location and if its convinient (assuming the lines are short). If they are religious, they would be more willing to participate in such a screening as well.

By increasing the portion of the population who gets preventative care, it could save the Indian gov't hospitals considerable amounts in tertiary care.

What are your thoughts? I am an aspiring developmental economist (currently a student). These are some of the issues that really keep me awake at night.

I will paste excerpts from it here  for the context:   


>Though Twitter has rules against “abuse and hateful conduct,” civil rights experts, government organizations, and Twitter users say the platform hasn’t done enough to [curb white supremacy and neo-Nazis](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7xnn8b/web-hosting-companies-shut-down-a-series-of-neo-nazi-websites) on the platform, and its competitor Facebook recently [explicitly banned white nationalism](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nexpbx/facebook-bans-white-nationalism-and-white-separatism). Wednesday, during a [parliamentary committee hearing on social media content moderation](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/24/mps-criticise-tech-giants-for-failure-to-report-criminal-posts-twitter-facebook-google-youtube), UK MP Yvette Cooper asked Twitter why it hasn’t yet banned former KKK leader David Duke, and “Jack, ban the Nazis” has [become a common reply](https://twitter.com/search?q=to%3Ajack%20ban%20the%20nazis&src=typd) to many of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s tweets. [During a recent interview with TED](https://www.fastcompany.com/90335799/jack-dorsey-defends-twitter-anti-abuse-ai-in-heated-ted) that allowed the public to tweet in questions, the feed was overtaken by people asking Dorsey why the platform hadn’t banned Nazis. Dorsey said “we have policies around violent extremist groups,” but did not give a straightforward answer to the question. Dorsey did not respond to two requests for comment sent via Twitter DM.

.....

>The argument that external experts made to Motherboard aligns with what the Twitter employee aired: Society as a whole uncontroversially and unequivocally demanded that Twitter take action against ISIS in the wake of beheading videos spreading far and wide on the platform. The automated approach that Twitter took to eradicating ISIS was successful: “I haven’t seen a legit ISIS supporter on Twitter who lasts longer than 15 seconds for two-and-a-half years,” Amarnath Amarasingam, an extremism researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told Motherboard in a phone call. Society and politicians were willing to accept that some accounts were mistakenly suspended by Twitter during that process (for example, accounts [belonging to the hacktivist group Anonymous](https://www.theepochtimes.com/hackers-say-twitter-isnt-telling-the-whole-story-about-anti-terror-fight_1983519.html) that were reporting ISIS accounts to Twitter as part of an operation called #OpISIS were themselves banned).

The aftermath of the Delhi pogroms looks just as grim as the riots,  the only good thing being the absence of blood bath. The fascist forces are running campaigns titled SupportHinduEconomy, and its no surprise their proposal is to boycott of Muslim businesses esp in the riot affected areas. They post many deplorable things and I'll paste some of them here.   


>If you are a hindu then don't give your money to terrorist to spread terrorism.  To support Hindu and Hindu Economy always bought from hindus.    
>  
>Stop calling M electrician in house call Hindu electrician only. 

I can paste hundreds of such tweets ( this campaign has garnered 85.4k tweets) and I'm sorry if it makes you feel sick in the gut like it does to me.   
Twitter's inaction on these accounts makes me more worried. Twitter is excessively used to promote nazi like ideology here in India. Many of these campaigns are paid and Twitter is also a beneficiary of these campaigns.

india,all,I transcribed the full text of Dr. Manmohan Singh's remarks on economic mismanagement by the current government in India,"*Transcript of the remarks by India’s former Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, about economic mismanagement under the Modi government. Sept 1 2019.*

The state of the economy today is deeply worrying. The last quarter’s GDP growth rate of 5 percent signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has the potential to grow at a much faster rate, but all-round mismanagement by the Modi government has resulted in this slowdown.

It is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector’s growth is tottering at 0.6 percent. This makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST. Domestic demand is depressed. And consumption growth is at an 18 month low. Nominal GDP growth is at 15 year low.

There is a gaping hole in tax revenues. Tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen, small and big, are hounded, and tax terrorism continues unabated. Investor sentiment are in doldrums. These are not the foundations for economic recovery.

The Modi government’s policies are resulted in massive jobless growth. More than 3.5 lakh Jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone. There will similarly be large scale job losses in the informal sector, hurting our most vulnerable workers.

Rural India is in terrible shape. Our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined. The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income, by inflicting misery on over 50 percent of India’s population.

Institutions are under attack, and their autonomy is being eroded. The resilience of the Reserve Bank will be tested after its record transfer of rupees 1.76 lakh crore to the government, which claims that it does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall. In addition, the credibility of India’s data has come under question under this government.

Budget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors. India has not been able to increase the exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignment. Such is the state of economic management under the Modi government.

Our youth, our farmers and our farm workers, entrepreneurs, and the marginalised section deserve better. India cannot afford to continue down this path. Therefore, I urge the Government to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.",724,157,2019-09-05,firasd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czvagp/i_transcribed_the_full_text_of_dr_manmohan_singhs/,i transcribed the full text of dr manmohan singhs remarks on economic mismanagement by the current government in india,transcript of the remarks by indias former prime minister dr manmohan singh about economic mismanagement under the modi government sept the state of the economy today is deeply worrying the last quarters gdp growth rate of percent signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown india has the potential to grow at a much faster rate but allround mismanagement by the modi government has resulted in this slowdown it is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sectors growth is tottering at percent this makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the manmade blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented gst domestic demand is depressed and consumption growth is at an month low nominal gdp growth is at year low there is a gaping hole in tax revenues tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen small and big are hounded and tax terrorism continues unabated investor sentiment are in doldrums these are not the foundations for economic recovery the modi governments policies are resulted in massive jobless growth more than lakh jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone there will similarly be large scale job losses in the informal sector hurting our most vulnerable workers rural india is in terrible shape our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined the low inflation rate that the modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income by inflicting misery on over percent of indias population institutions are under attack and their autonomy is being eroded the resilience of the reserve bank will be tested after its record transfer of rupees lakh crore to the government which claims that it does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall in addition the credibility of indias data has come under question under this government budget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors india has not been able to increase the exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignment such is the state of economic management under the modi government our youth our farmers and our farm workers entrepreneurs and the marginalised section deserve better india cannot afford to continue down this path therefore i urge the government to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this manmade crisis,transcribed full text dr manmohan singhs remarks economic mismanagement current government india,transcript remarks indias former prime minister dr manmohan singh economic mismanagement modi government sept state economy today deeply worrying last quarters gdp growth rate percent signals midst prolonged slowdown india potential grow much faster rate allround mismanagement modi government resulted slowdown particularly distressing manufacturing sectors growth tottering percent makes clear economy yet recovered manmade blunders demonetisation hastily implemented gst domestic demand depressed consumption growth month low nominal gdp growth year low gaping hole tax revenues tax buoyancy remains elusive businessmen small big hounded tax terrorism continues unabated investor sentiment doldrums foundations economic recovery modi governments policies resulted massive jobless growth lakh jobs lost automobile sector alone similarly large scale job losses informal sector hurting vulnerable workers rural india terrible shape farmers receiving adequate prices rural incomes declined low inflation rate modi government likes showcase comes cost farmers income inflicting misery percent indias population institutions attack autonomy eroded resilience reserve bank tested record transfer rupees lakh crore government claims plan windfall addition credibility indias data come question government budget announcements rollbacks shaken confidence international investors india able increase exports take advantage opportunities arisen global trade due geopolitical realignment state economic management modi government youth farmers farm workers entrepreneurs marginalised section deserve better india cannot afford continue path therefore urge government put aside vendetta politics reach sane voices thinking minds steer economy manmade crisis,False,-0.5377192497253418,Negative,Real Text

* 📖 Giveaway [Part 3]

After launching two successful book giveaways — first [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9z3lxo/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_1984_by/), and second [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a22a3v/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_animal_farm/) — and getting tremendous responses by everyone, I decided to do this more often. Although I am planning to make this a monthly thing, but this would require some time to set it up. I'll've to arrange proper channels to ease the process, and have more transparency and automation. I am already on it, and I think we can start off this by January! 😃

I asked for suggestions for this giveaway, and I got loads of it! Most requested books were *'Brave New World by Aldous Huxley'* and *'Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.'* So I thought of going with any one of them for this giveaway, but then there were issues with Amazon's Limited Quantity policy, and sellers. There are not many PRIME sellers for those books, and the sellers who are, have limited quantity filter applied. I've talked with those sellers to help me out, and they did explain me how I can bypass this filter and order books in those high quantities (200+)

Long story short, it would take some time to arrange all of that, and I am already on it, so we'll be able to do those books too, along with the others that came in suggestions, from January! So stay tuned if you're interested in those books.

Meanwhile, for this giveaway, I selected two of my all time favorite books:

**The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran**

**Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka**

On The Prophet: You have to read Gibran more than once to fully digest it. I think this book is amazing, with some really beautiful illustrations! I am not a religious person, but this classic, if digested properly, would appeal to any reader regardless of his/her present, absent or muddled religious beliefs. Despite your religious views, Gibran has given us a work of beauty that proves, that faith is not necessary to be good and right. This is not a holy book, but this is holier than the other so-called holy books! To be honest, I first picked this book, when I learned that Friedrich Nietzsche's 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra' was the inspiration behind The Prophet! This intrigued me first, and I am so glad that I picked this up.

On Metamorphosis: I first read this book in one sitting, and I remember how it stayed on my mind for long time. I've always loved reading Sartre, Camus, Beauvoir, and Kierkegaard, the most prominent of Existentialist Philosophers. Personally, I think it was a turning point in my life; it was not gradual, it was an epiphany, the 'why', the realization of the sheer absurdity of things. This is a powerful work, and one of the best in Existentialist literature. I mean it carves the path, you have to contemplate on it. The blend of absurd, surreal and mundane which gave rise to the adjective ""Kafkaesque."" This is a must read!

Quotes from the books:
> “I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain it to myself.” 

> ""And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.""

india,all,FIR filed by UIDAI against Tribune journalist who exposed Aadhaar breach. I'm pissed. Are you?,"Hello /r/India,

As you might be aware, an [FIR was filed by UIDAI](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fir-against-tribune-reporter-over-aadhaar-data-breach-story-5014674/) against Rachna Khaira, the journalist who reported the Aadhaar breach story in Tribune. This is a predictable response from the UIDAI and has happened multiple times before. 

Basically, their organizational policy seems to be to shut down whoever exposes flaws in Aadhaar. That is extremely unfair, to put it mildly, and makes me quite angry.

The only way to deal with this is to expose more flaws in their system. And there are almost too many to count. The volunteers of [#SpeakForMe campaign](https://www.speakforme.in/mp/?lang=en) have been doing a regular blog titled ""[Karana](https://medium.com/karana)"" where we are documenting all the flaws we can find. 

There's one tiny catch here though: It's all very very technical, for obvious reasons.

**We need help to simplify the flaws observed in Aadhaar so that more people understand the extent of how shitty the system is**

Sending emails to MPs was one way in which we thought we can raise our concerns regarding Aadhaar. Collectively, as citizens. That needs to continue but that is clearly not enough. 

We need to do more.

I'm angry and the only option I see at this point of time is to educate more people about Aadhaar and what a dangerous monster it has turned into. These journalists who are brave enough to fearlessly report on Aadhaar need support, which we must offer. More journalists need to realize that there is public support behind them and not to be afraid when reporting on Aadhaar.

I suggest we use videos, memes, blogs, tweets, FB posts, Whatsapp forwards and whatever other mediums we can grab hold of to talk MORE about Aadhaar. 

Expose MORE flaws. 

Educate MORE people.

Encourage MORE exposes.

If you are someone who can create material in any which way, if you have a reach online in whatever SM platform, please do help spread the word. Please keep talking about this.

Enough is enough. It's time to act. Expose Aadhaar for the shit-show that it has turned into in a sustained, consistent manner. 

I know there are a lot of people here on /r/india that are pissed too. Let's be angry together.

india,all,Basic mistake in our engineering colleges,"I teach engineering as a visiting professor at the local engineering college for fun. I used to be in academics but left that upon returning to India. Still miss teaching and research from time to time.

One problem that has remained constant in India is the way our engineering colleges, IITs included, admit students.

An 18 year old boy has no conception of what the world is like, especially in India. Parental pressure is immense. I remember when I entered IIT after doing decently at JEE, my family were pressuring me to take CS, but fortunately for myself, my counselor at IIT entrance was an old faculty who realized that I was not happy with that and helped me select a better line.

That doesn't happen for most people. Most boys are scared shitless of their parents because Indians infantilize their kids. The growing up happens only by the end of second year.

So, you have the situation of great designers who are stuck in CS but would have been happy in Mechanical engineering, and you have circuit whizkids who are stuck doing civil engineering.

Rank in a spot exam is a very poor measure of a student's ability to make the right career choice.

In the US, the system is very different. I recall when I used to serve as a faculty counselor for sophomores, we used to take the kid's performance, hobbies, career vision etc all into account before recommending a list of majors and minors to them. The result of such a process is excellent. Except in a few cases, where students went with their friends' recommendations, or did something downright stupid like chasing a girl or boy into a major, there was a very strong correlation between subsequent scholastic success and career satisfaction. Alumni feedback has consistently rated the counseling system very highly. It also reduces the risk by shortening the career choice and preparation window to about 20-25 credits rather than 60.

Typical division of credits is: 3:5:2 (common:major:minor). Electives make up the balance.

An additional side benefit of this is specialized training - you can have mixes like people doing a major in Aerospace engineering, and a minor in electronics, with electives in control systems and gyros, and end up as a compelling candidate for Raytheon or Lockheed Martin to hire. This is impossible under the Indian system.

In case of a mistake, subsequent changes of majors covers the remnant risk. The result is that most engineering UGs in tier I schools in US end up working in their discipline, which at the very basic minimum, avoids wasting an education (it is also priced correctly there).

In India, we have this strange obsession with forcing students to make career choices at least two years before they have sufficient information and mental maturity to be able to do so. This also skews our job market and creates the kind of problem that the Aspiring Minds survey found - too few qualified engineers.

If you hate what you are studying, you are going to want out, and owing to lack of interest, be unemployable. Most CS students, supposedly the highest ranked people, don't stay in CS. This is despite the lopsidedness of the market, which is finally beginning to correct a little.

I think that IITs and other engineering colleges should stop assigning branches on the basis of ranks, and instead should offer major and minors to students towards the end of their second year. This current system, which is unique to India, is doing a lot of harm to our education system, students, industry and ultimately the country itself.

_____________________________________

Edit: Didn't expect the response this thread has gotten. Whew!

Some respondents sound confused about possible subjective criteria and corruption. Upon mulling over their comments, I thought it best to clarify because they appear to have entirely misunderstood the system I am advocating.

The choice of a major/minor is made by the student, no one else. The difference is that that choice is now a hopefully informed choice after about 3-4 semesters of engineering school, exposure to actual Departments, and a basic clue about the actual state of the job market.

As a result, there is no reason to award ranks to students that survive JEE. In a sense, JEE becomes a screening test, instead of a single event ranking exam.

Second, only one person raised the question I was hoping to get - what stops every single student from opting for CS or EE?

Answer: nothing. Except grading of course. The student can figure out that getting a boatload of D's and F's in core CS courses, with a resulting GPA of 4-6 is not going to make them hot stuff for the recruiters. I am sometimes a recruiter for the company I now work for. We generally don't even look at students with GPA less than 7-7.5. Why? 

A CS student with a GPA of 6 screams that he is mediocre at CS. I would rather pick someone who is brilliant at civil engineering with a GPA of 9+. Yes, we tend to subject even IIT students to a training period of about 6 months.

I expect that it would take about a year for this lesson to sink in as we transition to this system. Then students will start accounting for counseling, rather than dumb fashions. This filters out the dumbos pretty quickly.

There is no subjectivity here. I am not advocating for the full US system of admissions (which is arguably superior to a spot exam) of essays, SATs and recommendations. That way won't work in the currently poisonous atmosphere of India.

________________

Edit 2: This has taken a life of its own. Thanks for the gold. It was not necessary. Appreciation, understanding and stimulating discussion are sufficient recompense.

A lot of people have asked about why we can't have ranks, at least to determine which campus students end up at. My response:

Ranks create a pecking order. A hierarchy. The difference in raw JEE score between someone with a rank of about 250 and 800 used to be about 15 points in the early 1990s. Imagine that. 15 points out of 300 on what was a uniformly tough exam with very few gimmes. Is that enough to condemn someone to a lifetime of being called rank 747 (a classmate still has the nickname Jumbo for that reason)? I think that for a spot exam, that is wrong. The differences are statistically insignificant.

Ranks will also ensure that the old school argument about majors being determined by ranks doesn't go away. This is India, with its sick obsession with seniority and rank, rather than the stuff that actually matters - competence and deliverables. No. If we want to bury the dead past, we have to make sure that ranks are never stored, considered, or released.

So how do we assign campuses?

Different campuses have different application windows (each internally being FCFS). Any candidate gets to apply to a maximum of 4 campuses. And put the windows for the two most desirable campuses (based on historical trends - Mumbai and Delhi), last. Any person who applied in any of the windows and didn't get any campus would be assigned a random campus, starting with the lowest occupancy campuses.

You could have:

June 1-3: Patna, Indore, Mandi

June 4-6: Ropar, Bhubhaneshwar, Jodhpur

June 7-9: Roorkee, ...

June 10-12: Guwahati, Gandhinagar, Kharagpur

June 14-16: Kanpur, Hyderabad, Madras

June 17-19: Mumbai, Delhi

In case of a candidate getting multiple campuses, his latest choice would override his earlier ones. In case of a tie (such as Mumbai and Delhi), he gets a random choice between those two.

The threat of getting a random campus that almost no one wants (such as Patna) will make sure that kids apply to at least a few campuses outside of old IITs + Hyderabad + Gandhinagar. Right now, the lowest rankers are going to those campuses which is locking them into an inescapable cycle of mediocrity. Am I admitting that rank matters? Well, if you are getting into the high thousands, it does make a statistical difference. However, that is not enough to demand a return to the ranks. Why? A GPA earned over 4-5 years in a major that is a good fit for the student is a far truer indicator of student ability than JEE rank is.

All that said, further, please feel free to contact ministries etc. with this. I did my bit by sending a short proposal on this to MHRD via their website last year. They have never responded. I don't think that our governance system is capable of generating, recognizing or executing system innovation, so that is no surprise. If you want to follow up with them, create a change.org petition, talk to colleagues and friends and create a critical mass for its adoption, please feel free to do so. This is just codified common sense helped in no small measure by my past experience in a superior education system, adjusted for Indian realities. I am just pleasantly surprised that there is some support for this.

I don't much like bureaucrats and politicians, so I won't be knocking on their doors. Even when they aren't being their venal selves (regardless of party), they are simply too dumb or uninvested to get the effect of their retarded and short-sighted policies on our country.",541,252,2016-04-15,despisedlove2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4eve9m/basic_mistake_in_our_engineering_colleges/,basic mistake in our engineering colleges,i teach engineering as a visiting professor at the local engineering college for fun i used to be in academics but left that upon returning to india still miss teaching and research from time to time one problem that has remained constant in india is the way our engineering colleges iits included admit students an year old boy has no conception of what the world is like especially in india parental pressure is immense i remember when i entered iit after doing decently at jee my family were pressuring me to take cs but fortunately for myself my counselor at iit entrance was an old faculty who realized that i was not happy with that and helped me select a better line that doesnt happen for most people most boys are scared shitless of their parents because indians infantilize their kids the growing up happens only by the end of second year so you have the situation of great designers who are stuck in cs but would have been happy in mechanical engineering and you have circuit whizkids who are stuck doing civil engineering rank in a spot exam is a very poor measure of a students ability to make the right career choice in the us the system is very different i recall when i used to serve as a faculty counselor for sophomores we used to take the kids performance hobbies career vision etc all into account before recommending a list of majors and minors to them the result of such a process is excellent except in a few cases where students went with their friends recommendations or did something downright stupid like chasing a girl or boy into a major there was a very strong correlation between subsequent scholastic success and career satisfaction alumni feedback has consistently rated the counseling system very highly it also reduces the risk by shortening the career choice and preparation window to about credits rather than typical division of credits is commonmajorminor electives make up the balance an additional side benefit of this is specialized training you can have mixes like people doing a major in aerospace engineering and a minor in electronics with electives in control systems and gyros and end up as a compelling candidate for raytheon or lockheed martin to hire this is impossible under the indian system in case of a mistake subsequent changes of majors covers the remnant risk the result is that most engineering ugs in tier i schools in us end up working in their discipline which at the very basic minimum avoids wasting an education it is also priced correctly there in india we have this strange obsession with forcing students to make career choices at least two years before they have sufficient information and mental maturity to be able to do so this also skews our job market and creates the kind of problem that the aspiring minds survey found too few qualified engineers if you hate what you are studying you are going to want out and owing to lack of interest be unemployable most cs students supposedly the highest ranked people dont stay in cs this is despite the lopsidedness of the market which is finally beginning to correct a little i think that iits and other engineering colleges should stop assigning branches on the basis of ranks and instead should offer major and minors to students towards the end of their second year this current system which is unique to india is doing a lot of harm to our education system students industry and ultimately the country itself edit didnt expect the response this thread has gotten whew some respondents sound confused about possible subjective criteria and corruption upon mulling over their comments i thought it best to clarify because they appear to have entirely misunderstood the system i am advocating the choice of a majorminor is made by the student no one else the difference is that that choice is now a hopefully informed choice after about semesters of engineering school exposure to actual departments and a basic clue about the actual state of the job market as a result there is no reason to award ranks to students that survive jee in a sense jee becomes a screening test instead of a single event ranking exam second only one person raised the question i was hoping to get what stops every single student from opting for cs or ee answer nothing except grading of course the student can figure out that getting a boatload of ds and fs in core cs courses with a resulting gpa of is not going to make them hot stuff for the recruiters i am sometimes a recruiter for the company i now work for we generally dont even look at students with gpa less than why a cs student with a gpa of screams that he is mediocre at cs i would rather pick someone who is brilliant at civil engineering with a gpa of yes we tend to subject even iit students to a training period of about months i expect that it would take about a year for this lesson to sink in as we transition to this system then students will start accounting for counseling rather than dumb fashions this filters out the dumbos pretty quickly there is no subjectivity here i am not advocating for the full us system of admissions which is arguably superior to a spot exam of essays sats and recommendations that way wont work in the currently poisonous atmosphere of india edit this has taken a life of its own thanks for the gold it was not necessary appreciation understanding and stimulating discussion are sufficient recompense a lot of people have asked about why we cant have ranks at least to determine which campus students end up at my response ranks create a pecking order a hierarchy the difference in raw jee score between someone with a rank of about and used to be about points in the early s imagine that points out of on what was a uniformly tough exam with very few gimmes is that enough to condemn someone to a lifetime of being called rank a classmate still has the nickname jumbo for that reason i think that for a spot exam that is wrong the differences are statistically insignificant ranks will also ensure that the old school argument about majors being determined by ranks doesnt go away this is india with its sick obsession with seniority and rank rather than the stuff that actually matters competence and deliverables no if we want to bury the dead past we have to make sure that ranks are never stored considered or released so how do we assign campuses different campuses have different application windows each internally being fcfs any candidate gets to apply to a maximum of campuses and put the windows for the two most desirable campuses based on historical trends mumbai and delhi last any person who applied in any of the windows and didnt get any campus would be assigned a random campus starting with the lowest occupancy campuses you could have june patna indore mandi june ropar bhubhaneshwar jodhpur june roorkee june guwahati gandhinagar kharagpur june kanpur hyderabad madras june mumbai delhi in case of a candidate getting multiple campuses his latest choice would override his earlier ones in case of a tie such as mumbai and delhi he gets a random choice between those two the threat of getting a random campus that almost no one wants such as patna will make sure that kids apply to at least a few campuses outside of old iits hyderabad gandhinagar right now the lowest rankers are going to those campuses which is locking them into an inescapable cycle of mediocrity am i admitting that rank matters well if you are getting into the high thousands it does make a statistical difference however that is not enough to demand a return to the ranks why a gpa earned over years in a major that is a good fit for the student is a far truer indicator of student ability than jee rank is all that said further please feel free to contact ministries etc

india,all,Scary disclosures on use of NSO spyware in India signal a need for urgent reform,"&#x200B;

Today, the Indian Express [**broke a story**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/whatsapp-confirms-israeli-spyware-used-snoop-on-indian-journalists-activists-pegasus-facebook-6095296/) about how spyware developed by an Israeli cyber-intelligence firm, NSO Group was used on dalit activists, journalists and lawyers in India. The spyware, “Pegasus” would be installed through a missed call on Whatsapp after which an attacker would gain complete access to a smartphone. As per the NSO Group, “Pegasus” was only sold to government clients. Subsequent reports by [**Huffington Post**](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/whatsapp-hacking-bhima-koregaon-lawyers-targeted_in_5dba8e9ae4b066da552c5028) and [**News Laundry**](https://www.newslaundry.com/2019/10/31/breaking-bela-bhatia-anand-teltumbde-among-indians-snooped-on-using-israeli-spyware)have revealed that the targets include lawyers in the Bhima Koregaon case, Bela Bhatia and Anand Teltumbde. This raises some extremely disturbing questions about likely illegal hacking by unknown government agencies- or other actors operating in India- and suggests flagrant disregard for the rule of law and contempt for our fundamental right to privacy.

There is an urgent need for official disclosure on whether and how this spyware was used in India to hack our citizens. The Government of India must issue an official public statement providing complete information. The Government must also clarify which law empowers it to install such spyware. To the best of our understanding and knowledge, no such power exists under Indian law, and the pre-existing surveillance powers available under the Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 do not permit the installation of spyware or hacking mobile devices. Hacking of computer resources, including mobile phones and apps, is in fact a criminal offence under the Information Technology Act, 2000.

This expose signals a need for urgent surveillance reform to protect citizens against the use of malware, spyware and creation of vulnerabilities in technologies which offer privacy protection by design. We call on the Government to stand by democratic commitments and reject the use of spyware in their pursuit of social objectives of policing and security. Legislative measures must be introduced in Parliament to uphold the 9 judge bench decision of the Supreme Court of India recognizing privacy as a fundamental right. The use of legal or technical means to access data and intercept communications in India must be authorised only in emergency situations, under judicial control and oversight, and with other protections to safeguard our citizens.

Over the next few weeks, we at IFF will attempt to reach out to any victims of illegal surveillance in India and we will make every attempt to ensure that they can access the legal system to seek redress. We will also examine avenues for further engagement with all branches of government - legislative, executive and judicial- to advance our ongoing work on surveillance reform.  

In addition to seeking transparency through full disclosure, we hope to work towards solutions to ensure that something like this never happens again. We will continue our public advocacy through the SaveOurPrivacy Campaign which seeks to put forth a model draft law that provides for judicial oversight and parliamentary controls in the surveillance process. In July, a revised version of this model draft law was introduced in Parliament as a private member’s bill by Dr. Ravikumar as the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 which if enacted may help prevent such a recurrence.

india,all,Help us out? Non-profit CGNet needs to make a collaborative database of gov. officials in central India. (This sounds way boring but could actually be super important),"I work for a organization called CGNet, a mobile-phone based media platform that operates throughout central India (some of you may have heard of us, our founder Shubhranshu Choudhary was just named one of Foreign Policy magazine's 100 Global Thinkers of 2014). Check out our website at www.cgnetswara.org

Much of this part of the world can be accurately described as a media blackspot: rural, poor and tribal communities are not sexy enough topics for mainstream media to usually concern themselves with and so the basic problems that plague these areas - bad services, insanitary conditions, abuses by government officials - lack the platform necessary to turn them into pressing issues. 

CGNet's aims are pretty modest. We maintain a server here in Bhopal that allows anyone to ring in and make a report and - if it raises community issues - we publish it online (anyone who calls up can also listen to these messages). If the schoolteacher in your village never shows up: call us about it. If the village handpump is broken: call us about is. If the Forest department is illegally evicting your family: call us about it.

Our banks of reports allow anyone who listens in to also take action. A government official may easily ignore the problems of the poor inhabitants of a remote village, but if these problems are boosted by many people calling up and demanding something then the official may just do something about it. That's what we've found, anyway. Some people call this citizen journalism; we like to think of it as boosting people's voices.

So here's why I'm posting: Central India is really, really big. Finding the contact details of the official responsible for, say, a broken handpump in a village in Rewa District, Madhya Pradesh is actually super hard. I spent all of today and yesterday trawling through all of the district websites of Chhattisgarh and MP trying to build a database that includes everyone we could ever need to call and I haven't eve scratched the surface of necessary contacts: block SDMs, medical officers, panchayat CEOs, the forest department, Public Works Department officers, village Sarpanchs and secretaries etc. etc. 

Unfortunately, this is a pretty big job. In Chhattisgarh alone there are 27 districts, further subdivided into innumerable blocks which cover thousands and thousands of villages and panchayats. Finding all of this information is impossible for one man (me) so I wanted some help making a big old online database (that people can help maintain and contribute to) that will collect all of this information in one place.

This isn't just for our organization. Obviously, this will be open for use by anyone. Most of these local government portals in MP and CG are monstrously bad informationwise anyway (check this example out: http://khandwa.nic.in/) so this will also be a useful resource for everyone. 

I have precisely zero experience initiating this kind of project: if anyone out there can point me in a direction to go in (or, better yet, get involved directly) comment underneath and maybe we can all gather on some kind of forum and make plans and whatnot. This is a step towards a more responsive/responsible government for everyone.
