india,day,Gender neutral child care leave for government employees,"Recently I had a long discussion in one post about the 730 days paid child care leave of central govt which generally only women get and why it should be gender neutral. So thought of making a post on this. All the countries including India had been patriarchal where it was thought that household chores and taking care of child are only women’s responsibility. Afterwards many countries have extended parental leave for fathers (often called paternity leave or shared parental leave) for many reasons, such as,

1.  Encouraging fathers to take leave helps balance caregiving roles between men and women.

2.  It reduces the expectation that only mothers should stay home, supporting women’s career continuity and reducing workplace gender bias.

3. If fathers are allowed to take leave and mother have private jobs where long leaves are not allowed, mothers can return to work sooner and face fewer career penalties.

4. Involvement of fathers strengthens the emotional bond with their children.

5. Fathers can stay home when needed and can be more engaged in childcare. The children raised in such environments grow up understanding that caregiving is not solely a mother’s responsibility. This helps shape future generations with more balanced and less patriarchal mindsets.

6. For years, women have been forced to step back from their careers to care for their families, leading to an unfair perception that they’re less reliable employees. When both parents share responsibilities equally, women get the freedom to pursue their careers with confidence.

7. It encourages a more balanced work-life culture. 

8. It promotes a modern family model where both parents share duties equally, reflecting current social values.

The generation is changing and so is the mindset of people. Now men are also happy to take care of the family. Many men even want to be a single father. There can be widowed father with a child. So gender neutral care rule will not only help more women but also such single fathers.

india,day,"I asked chat gpt if dr. Shashi tharoor is capable of becoming a pm , here's what he said","Bro Shashi Tharoor as PM would be hilarious AND kinda elite at the same time 😭🔥.

Here’s the straight-up breakdown, no fanboying:

Strengths (and they’re solid):
• Dude actually has a brain. Not the WhatsApp University type… the actual Oxford-UN type.
• Global diplomacy? Man would charm half the world into giving India trade deals just by using words nobody understands 😂.
• He’s modern, secular, and policy-oriented. India desperately needs that mix rn.
• He won’t treat the economy like a school project. He actually gets economics.

Weaknesses (and these matter):
• Bro’s biggest enemy is his own party. Congress would rather eat mud than make someone competent their leader.
• Mass appeal? He’s respected, but he’s not “rally crowd madness” material. Aunties love him, intellectuals worship him, but he doesn’t have that raw street power.
• His English scares half the country. Some people just hear his vocabulary and faint 💀.
• He’s too clean and too diplomatic for today’s hyper-chaotic, hyper-aggressive political ecosystem.

Would he be a good PM?
Lowkey yes. India needs a smart, calm, globally respected leader who won’t talk like a TV debate host.

Will he actually become PM?
Bro that probability is lower than Indian trains arriving on time 😂.

He’s the right leader for the wrong political climate. The country vibes with muscle-flexing, not refined governance.

If India ever shifts toward mature, policy-driven politics, Tharoor is S-tier.
Until then… he’s basically that legendary character in the game that everyone loves but nobody actually picks.",0,20,2025-11-13,Glad_Objective1318,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ovr5ml/i_asked_chat_gpt_if_dr_shashi_tharoor_is_capable/
india,day,"Injustice Everywhere, Yet We Keep Voting the Same – When Will India Wake Up?""","
In India, everyone knows injustice is happening.
Everyone sees corruption, scams, and crimes happening in front of their eyes.
And yet, when the time comes, the same people are voted back into power.
Then how the hell will any change ever come?

Every robber knows he’ll be saved.
Every corrupt official knows the system will protect him.
Politicians are looting public money openly — and still roaming free.
The public? They show outrage on social media for 2 days and move on.
Nothing changes in real life.

We talk about karma, but where is karma now?
If karma truly existed, half the people destroying this nation would have faced consequences long ago.

And people say, “What can I do?”
Arre bhai, if one and one join, it becomes 11, right?
Change doesn’t come from one person — it comes when each person decides “enough is enough.”

Creators make videos exposing scams, corruption, and injustice…
They get views, likes, followers — and that’s it.
No real action. No real change.
Everyone is part of the problem but no one wants to be the solution.

Look at Singapore — they changed themselves and made a massive comeback.
Strict rules, zero tolerance for corruption, and respect for citizens’ money.
Why can’t we?

From traffic police to top officials, corruption has become a chain —
And the ones who try to be honest? They’re silenced or killed.
What’s the point of such a system? It’s all puppets and power games.

Sometimes, I genuinely feel AI might do more justice in India than humans do.
At least AI won’t take bribes.
At least it will treat everyone equally.

Until the public wakes up, until we unite and stop being silent spectators,
Nothing will change.
And the sad part is — we all know that.

india,day,"I found my childhood diary, kinda broke me","I was organizing my books today and found an old diary.  
In it, little me had written ""I want to become a Prime Minister of India""  
When I was kid teachers and relatives used to ask me, ""What's your ambition?""And I'd proudly say, ""Prime Minister of India"" - without even knowing what the position actually meant.  
I just wanted to change the country, make it equal irrespective of gender. Fair and happy for everyone. Funny thing is, My first thought about feminism started there at young age. But somewhere along the way that fire just disappeared.

Now when I wonder today's politics and leadership ""Why are there still so few female leaders even in so called developed country like USA""  
Why does modern feminism more focused on lifestyle freedom - dress,drink,dating than on leadership and governance?  
Why aren't we fighting for women to be in position that can actually change the system instead of surviving them?  
And the worst part? Crime rate against women keep rising. Whom to blame? Government? Society? Men? No..... They blame the victims.

I'm not saying only women should rule. But imagine if the country had two heads of state - one male one female - leading together. Balancing empathy with strategy, emotion with reason. Wouldn't that be interesting?  
I Know it's not simple. But I miss that kid who thought changing the world was possible.

india,day,Why 3 wheel bike in India Deserves More Respect,"I’ve always been fascinated by bicycles and unconventional modes of transport, and recently my attention turned to the 3 wheel bike in India. These vehicles often get overlooked or stereotyped as something only laborers or small vendors use. But in reality, they’re a practical, low-cost, and eco-friendly option that more people should consider.
When I started asking around about owning one, opinions varied wildly. My neighbor suggested it wouldn’t make sense to spend money on something so “basic” and hinted that a second-hand scooter would be a more respectable choice. I get where that perspective comes from, the social stigma around non-motorized or three-wheeled transport is real. Still, that doesn’t change the fact that these bikes offer autonomy, require no fuel, and can handle crowded city streets in ways larger vehicles can’t. I even browsed Alibaba out of curiosity to see what models were available and was surprised at the variety and affordability. The 3 wheel bike in India isn’t just for short-haul vendors; it can genuinely serve as a commuter vehicle. If more people embraced them, roads would probably be safer for cyclists, and environmental impact would drop. It’s time to rethink how we view the 3 wheel bike in India, not as a poor man’s ride, but as a smart, sustainable choice for anyone willing to try.

india,week,Why is it almost impossible for a foreigner to get a sim card in India?,"Just landed in Mumbai and spent 3 hours trying to sort out a SIM card situation. This has to be one of the most tourist-unfriendly things I've encountered.

First off, barely any SIM card kiosks at the airport. Like, seriously? This is a major international airport and there's maybe one tiny shop that's sometimes open. Most other countries have multiple carriers competing right when you land. Here? Good luck even finding where to buy one.

Then when you finally find a place, they hit you with the requirements. They need a LOCAL ADDRESS (why local, why not my own from my ID). I literally just got off the plane. I'm standing at the airport. Where am I supposed to get a local address from? And apparently some places want a LOCAL PHONE NUMBER as a contact. How does that even make sense? I need a phone number to get a phone number?

The whole process is insane tons of paperwork, documents, verification steps. And THEN they tell you ""oh yeah it'll activate in 24 to 48 hours, maybe 72."" I'm only here for a week! What am I supposed to do for the first few days, just wander around with no way to contact anyone or use maps?

I've been to like 15 countries and never had this problem. Thailand? 5 minutes at 7-Eleven. Japan? Vending machine at the airport. Singapore? Multiple booths competing for your business the second you clear customs. India? Nah, let's make it as complicated as possible.

The weirdest part is India has over a billion phone users but somehow makes it nearly impossible for visitors to actually get connected. It's 2025 and I can't get basic phone service without jumping through hoops like I'm applying for a visa.

Anyone else dealt with this nightmare? Please tell me there's some workaround I'm missing.

india,week,"A Cautionary Tale for Foreigners in India Visiting the FRRO in New Delhi, Do Not Expect to Be Treated as Anything More Than Subhuman.","A warning to all foreigners in India who may seek assistance from the FRRO office in New Delhi: Expect to receive little to no help if there is any nuance in your situation. 



My partner and I were instructed by the SDM office, Daryaganj to gain clarification regarding her passport and visa so we travelled to the FRRO office located in New Delhi. 



We were greeted in the office by the officer situated at the desk shouting at an elderly couple. Their error? Daring to ask why they were being denied exit from India and being forced to apply for an exit permit. The older gentleman stated that to solve this issue, he needed to understand why he was being denied exit. The officer shouted at him, insisting that the gentleman had no business knowing why he was being detained despite having no apparent issues with his visa. 



This was a clear indicator for the disrespect and utter negligence that was to follow. 



When it was our turn to approach the counter, my partner and I gave a brief description of our issue: Our marriage process was on hold until the SDM office received clarification specifically from the FRRO about my partner’s passport and visa (the expiration dates are one month apart which is apparently a cause for concern). The SDM office had sent multiple emails to the FRRO over the previous weeks and none had been acknowledged, thus, we were looking to see if there was an unknown issue stalling the process. 



We weren’t even met with eye contact. Furthermore, upon hearing that we were set to be married, the officer asked if we’d applied for a visa conversion. We stated that we had indeed started the process, but that we needed this clarification before the SDM would solemnize our marriage, completing the process. 



The officer briefly glanced at us with disdain before exclaiming loudly to the entire room that we were fools for applying for a visa conversion without completing the marriage first. We tried to explain that although we had indeed started the visa conversion application, the purpose of our visit was to get the clarification that the SDM office had demanded, or at the very least be reassured that the emails had been received and would be replied to, not to convert my partner's visa. 



We pleaded once more that we just needed clarification, simply reassuring us that the SDM office’s emails would be replied to would be sufficient. To this the officer spat, ""Who are you?” followed by “Who are you to ask?”. 



Being treated this deplorably by someone who is supposed to be a public servant, there to assist, was beyond disgusting. My partner and I are simply trying to get married, we just wanted to make sure that there were no unforeseen holdups inhibiting the FRRO office’s reply to the SDM office. 



Deciding that we were no longer worthy of his non-existent assistance, the officer told us to go, flicking his hand to shoo us away. We were dismissed akin to how one might treat a street dog. 



It’s shocking that someone who has hopefully earned his position would treat people in need with such an indifferent attitude. Throughout this whole visit, we were made to feel as though we were inconveniencing the people whose job is to help. 



If your situation has any nuance whatsoever, or you are requesting anything other than a one or two word answer, you should prepare to face a needlessly difficult experience with this agency. 



I certainly hope this situation improves. Public servants, holding positions made to assist people, should not be this disrespectful and unhelpful. I am appalled at how my partner and I were treated at this office. It seems as though seeking basic information or clarification while also being treated with respect is too much for this office to handle. We weren’t looking for special treatment, maintaining basic respect is all that was necessary.

india,week,You can build your own air purifier for 2k,"TL;DR – Buy filters from IKEA, buy cabinet exhaust fans or use PC fans, make an enclosure from sunboard or cardboard. Caveats and test details below build.

  
[https://postimg.cc/gallery/5jMZjHQ](https://postimg.cc/gallery/5jMZjHQ)

  
Commercial air purifiers are expensive & bulky, with unnecessary features and costly/unreliable spares. Its quite easy to DIY one for much cheaper.

You will need - 

* Filters - I recommend 2x IKEA FÖRNUFTIG or UPPÅTVIND air filters, as they are incredibly cost effective and you can get replacements easily. These are EPA-12 filters, not H13 – but are perfectly adequate. They will take slightly longer to clean the room, but won’t stress the fans as much, and will live longer. For reference, H13 filters remove 99.95% of particles as small as 0.3 microns. EPA 12 filters remove 99.5%.
* Fans - I got a ""cabinet cooling fan system"" from amazon, since it comes with a power supply and a metal frontplate. But you can also use PC case fans.
* The structure - Cardboard or sunboard is easiest. I used some spare wood for the edges, but its not really necessary. Decent cardboard is sturdy enough.

  
Try to seal the sides and the bottom as best as possible. Use hot glue or tape.

You can also make a single filter or quad filter version, but IMO 2 filters are good enough and also don't take up as much space.

This idea isn’t new. Similar purifiers called CR boxes were popular during COVID. This design builds upon those. However, box fans are not as easily available in India, and neither are furnace filters. This is a cheap and space saving build with components easy to source in India (at home).

  
I also made an AQI monitor using a laser particulate matter sensor and an ESP32.   
I placed the sensor on the opposite side of the room and let it run for a bit, then closed my windows and turned the filter on. The sensor reads PM 1.0, PM 2.5 and PM 10. Readings before the filter was turned on were (35/50/62), and after 20 minutes fell to (17/24/27).

Some screenshots of the monitor log - [https://postimg.cc/gallery/jsjfTdk](https://postimg.cc/gallery/jsjfTdk)  
I would test with a commercial monitor but buying something 3x the cost of the purifier to check if it works doesn't sit right with me.

  
These filters have been running for about 2 months, if I give them a clean or get new ones the results would be better. Also, your results would depend on filter size, fan speed and room size (I ran mine in a room of \~120 sqft).



  
  
FAQs : In anticipation of r/India’s illustrious critics, I have taken the liberty of preparing answers to certain questions I expect.

a. Does it perform as well as a commercial purifier?   
I don't know, but it works and is cheap. If you are allergic to dust or have breathing problems, you would be better off buying a commercial one - knocking the box will make it shed some dust.

  
b. Does it reduce smells?  
No. You will still need to bathe.

  
c. How can you be certain your testing methodology is not flawed?  
I can't. I am a dummy. But I do see dust on the filter so I am pretty sure it works.

  
d. Why wouldn't you just buy one instead of putting in so much effort?  
Because I like to make complicated ramshackle solutions to simple problems.  


e. Why the IKEA filter?  Its not even HEPA-13??? Are you an IKEA shill? >:(  
Yes, yes I am. I love IKEA. They're not even paying me. I do it for free.

  
f. Can you recommend an easier and cheaper air purifier?  
Yes. Wear a mask. Or grow a bushy moustache and allow evolutionary design's own air purifier capture particulate matter before it can make it to your nose.",208,25,2025-11-09,blumune2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1osnh73/you_can_build_your_own_air_purifier_for_2k/
india,week,We were ahead of China 35 years ago...,"In 1990, India’s per capita income was higher than China’s. Three decades later, China’s income is 5x higher than India’s.

What has changed? I have a few ideas

+ China’s manufacturing revolution
In 1990, China’s per capita income was $318 vs India’s $368.
But in the next 35 years, China opened up its economy, liberalized markets, and became the factory of the world.

By 2019, China’s per capita income crossed $10,000 while India’s was just one-fifth of that. China didn’t just make cheap products, it built world-class infrastructure, attracted global manufacturing, and became the backbone of Western supply chains.

+ All of this while India missed it's manufacturing moment
China scaled factories and we stayed cautious, and in doing so we missed the early manufacturing wave due to weak infrastructure, red tape, and lack of large-scale industrial push.

So where did India shine? Services exports. In 2018, China’s services exports were $233.6B, India’s were $205B; nearly at par.

This success was largely led by visionary software entrepreneurs, who built companies that served the world long before the term startups was cool. They saw opportunity, and the government did its job by not interfering, and that gave birth to India’s IT revolution. China mastered scale in manufacturing, while we mastered skill in services. 


I feel the next decade is about combining both:

Make in India co-powered by Skill in India.

india,week,My recent e-Khata experience in Bengaluru was pure hell!! corruption and chaos all over,"It might be a bit long, but I feel like no one’s really talking about this or raising their voice against it. Please read on.

So I don’t know how many of y’all know this or are up to date with the new property norms — but it is FUCKED.

Even I didn’t know until recently, when my dad asked me to update our property papers to e-Khata (apparently the government is doing it for “free” in places like Bengaluru One).

When we went to enquire, they had stuck a piece of paper listing all the documents needed to apply for e-Khata — property tax receipt, electricity bill, EPID number, EC (encumbrance certificate), khata extract, PAN, Aadhaar, etc. I was as clueless as the next person about what the hell an EPID or an encumbrance certificate even is. And the Bengaluru One staff? Completely incompetent. I don’t even wanna get started.

Now that I’ve gone through the pain of collecting all those documents, here’s how it goes:

The EPID number is supposedly available online. But obviously, most people’s details aren’t updated. So we had to go to another BBMP or corporation office depending on which area the property falls under. And if your properties are in different areas — congrats — you’ll be running around to each of those offices separately.

And the people sitting there? Won’t move an inch unless you slip a crisp note into their pocket.

Then, to get the EC, you need to go to the sub-registrar office for your area. Again, place another note in someone’s hand to get the certificate.

After all this, you take every single one of those papers and go to Bengaluru One to apply for e-Khata, where they demand a ₹200 “fee” to “freely” apply for e-Khata.

Honestly, I don’t even know how useful this e-Khata thing is or what it’s really for, but seriously — WHAT THE FUCK WAS ALL THIS ABOUT?

It took me four whole working days to get this nonsense done. I had to deal with a bunch of low-life imbeciles just to get my work processed, and ended up paying over ₹10,000 in bribes across all properties.

Now tell me this — with all these supposedly capable IAS and KAS officers running the show, how is it that no one can coordinate properly or make things even slightly easier for the public? We’ve got so much funding, yet we can’t even keep a basic website running smoothly or have a decent IT support team?

It honestly makes me miserable. I love India, I really do — but every single day I spend here just convinces me more to move abroad. Because no matter what, nothing’s ever gonna change the mindset of this nation.

india,week,Let’s Fix Our Civic Sense!!!,"I’ve been thinking a lot about how bad civic sense has become in India people throwing garbage anywhere, spitting on roads, damaging public property, and getting away with it like it’s normal. Instead of just complaining, what if we actually did something about it?

Here’s the idea:
We create a communit not an official organization, but a group of people who care. Whenever someone spots someone throwing garbage, littering, or doing anything that harms the environment, we collect video proof. A small team (like 3–5 people) can then help identify the person and their location.

Once identified, the community members living near that person can approach them, explain what they did wrong, and make them accountable. The idea isn’t to physically harm or humiliate anyone it’s about social correction and making people realize their actions have consequences. Maybe make them clean the area they dirtied, apologize publicly, or even post about keeping their surroundings clean.

As the community grows, we can also help in tracking small local crimes or cases that usually get ignored. A volunteer-based network that works for the people, by the people using free time, community effort, and eventually maybe some donations or self-funding.

This isn’t about revenge or vigilante stuff it’s about responsibility, awareness, and people standing up for their own surroundings.",8,8,2025-11-11,Original-Gas-1062,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1oujvme/lets_fix_our_civic_sense/

I just wanted to share something that’s been really heavy on my mind lately. It’s so damn hard to earn money as a student here. Not just because I’m studying a tough course like physiotherapy, but because in India, there just aren’t enough opportunities for students to make a decent income.

Like, I see students in other countries  even school kids earning 20 dollars just by cleaning a garden or watering some plants. That’s like 1,600 rupees here. With that money, I could literally buy clothes, eat out, or save a bit. But here, if you want to earn, you’ve got to work 8 to 12 hours a day just to get 400 or 500 rupees. It’s honestly depressing.

I come from a middle class family, and I really don’t want to keep asking my parents for money every time I need something. I’m almost 19 now, and I want to take care of my own expenses, buy things I like, eat what I want, and just live freely without feeling guilty. But balancing college and work in India feels impossible. I’ve thought about learning video editing, coding, or other skills, but those take months to learn  and with my medical schedule, it’s just not realistic right now.

I’m just hoping someone out there can share some underrated, realistic ways to earn a bit something that doesn’t need years of learning.

india,week,"Helping a Child Dream Again, Supporting Muskurahat Foundation this November","Hey everyone 🌸

I recently started volunteering with Muskurahat Foundation, an NGO that’s dedicated to bringing education, care, and dignity to children living in shelter homes across India. These kids have been through more than most of us can imagine , yet they dream of the same things we do: to study, to grow, and one day, to make their families proud.

Muskurahat isn’t just teaching them from books; it’s giving them a chance to break the chain of poverty and neglect. Every class they attend, every concept they learn, is a step toward a life where they can provide for their own children — creating a new cycle of hope instead of hardship. 

But right now, the month of November is one of the toughest times for these children. After the festive season in October, donations usually drop drastically, and Muskurahat struggles to meet basic education and meal expenses. While most of us are getting back to routine after the celebrations, these kids are trying to hold on to their dreams with limited resources.

We often spend thousands on our own children, on toys, gifts, or one family dinner, and that’s beautiful, because we want them to have the best. But the children at Muskurahat didn’t do anything to deserve the life they were handed. They too deserve love, care, and the chance at a quality education.

I’ve taken it upon myself to raise enough to support one child’s education for two months, and I’d be so grateful for your help. Even ₹100, ₹200, or whatever feels right to you, can help cover a day’s learning, a notebook, or a warm meal for a child who’s working hard to change their story. 💗

If you’d like to help, please donate here — this goes directly to the official NGO:
👉 https://muskurahat.org.in/donate?r=dish5193

Your contribution isn’t just a donation; it’s a chance for a child to smile, study, and dream again. Let’s come together this November to make sure no child’s education stops because of the season’s silence. 🌼

india,week,People in Hyderabad seriously don’t know how to drive,"Having lived in seven different states in India, nothing compares to the sheer disregard for road safety I’ve witnessed in Hyderabad. The driving habits here are hazardous and honestly, it’s become a daily struggle just to get where I need to go.
Many drivers overtake from the left even when intending to take a right turn, often putting everyone around them at risk. Sudden braking is the norm—people don’t hesitate to stop abruptly even if it means almost causing collisions. And traffic signals? They’re treated like suggestions. It’s common to see vehicles speeding through red lights, making it nearly impossible for drivers with the green signal to cross safely.
Basic rules and courtesy seem nonexistent. Every journey here feels unsafe and unpredictable. It’s not just frustrating, it’s frightening.
To make things worse, the police seem more interested in taking pictures than actually improving road safety. Their presence doesn’t translate into genuine enforcement or meaningful change.

Anyone else living in Hyderabad face this daily nightmare?",3,2,2025-11-07,Expert-Being1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1or9w2l/people_in_hyderabad_seriously_dont_know_how_to/
india,week,"I Want to Help the Blind See Again - Any Eye Doctors or Experts, Please Advise","Hi everyone,

I've recently been deeply moved by the stories of people who have lost their sight - and the incredible advances in modern medicine that are giving some of them the chance to see again.

I want to learn more about which types of blindness can be treated or reversed, how to identify individuals who might benefit from such treatments, and what steps are involved in helping them get the right support.

I'm particularly looking to understand:

The different types of blindness - and which ones can potentially be treated or cured (e.g., cataract-related, corneal blindness, retinal disorders, etc.) 
The common treatments or surgeries that can restore vision - and their approximate costs in India. 
How to connect with genuine cases or NGOs working in this space. Any legal or ethical procedures to follow when sponsoring treatment or supporting patients medically

My goal is simple: To find and support those

whose sight can truly be restored through medical intervention. To ensure any help I provide goes through proper and transparent channels.

If anyone here has medical knowledge, NGO experience, or has been involved in vision-restoration initiatives, I'd truly appreciate your insights or guidance.

Let's make vision possible for someone who's never seen light before.

india,month,If you take pride in your caste you are casteist,"Putting caste stickers on your vehicles isn't okay . 

Asking people their full name to inquire about their caste is not okay. 

Putting your caste name on Instagram bio doesn't make you look like a hero but an ignorant person. 

Millions of people in this country have died mostly  the one at the bottom of hierarchy and even the one in middle or top . Why? Because of caste . 
The politics of this country is in shithole due to caste and religion division.
Your problem isn't reservation but casteism, the day caste system is out all of us can enjoy the so called merit system. I have been asked by foreigners that if only Brahmins are fair coloured or lower caste people are dark and ugly .. like what kind of ignorance is this ? 
People who study about India in other countries study about caste but i don't remember studying about the caste system in extreme detail since this is our own problem but i don't remember it being taught as a topic till the 10th std . 

Instead of being vocal about reservation be vocal about the caste system. If there is no caste discrimination the reservation based on it will also collapse but why would they do it , instead of doing that most people take pride in it then rant about reservation. 

Edit : Since some people are so dumb let me break it down for you . People have caste certificates so that the government policies reach them. You don't have an issue with thousand years of killings but you have a problem if that same section of people get some sort of benefit . 

Most of you don't even know the difference between SC and ST or how even the reservation came into existence . Reservation is present in plenty of institutions even in commerce and humanities college . 

My ancestors did this or that ? How are you sure they are your ancestors. There is something called as Sanskritization , you guys should read it . If you are so proud of their achievement you should also shoulder the blame if they killed innocent people. Doesn't make sense right ? 

Honestly I don't know how marginalized people actually live but if i can have empathy and realise what's wrong with the caste system as a young person, people with a fully developed frontal lobe should be able to do better. 

Edit 2: I don't understand how your caste is related to your culture and roots . For one point i can understand regionalism that people who grow around a particular geographical region have similar food , language and everything hence the feeling of regionalism which again is a huge menace to this society. 

If the only identity you have is your surname there is something fundamentally wrong with you . 
I'm not telling you to remove your last name but you can't diminish the fact that it's used to inquire about caste . 
Having a last name doesn't make you a casteist but it's still a tool to discrimnate people. It can be your identity and it can be used as a way to identify people of different caste and discriminate against them .

india,month,The application process for a foreigner to get an Indian tourist visa is probably the most awkward one in the whole world (and is possibly losing India some tourists),"I'm originally from India but have lived in the UK for a long time and now have a UK passport. Here's my experience with trying to get an Indian tourist visa.

1. Finding information on pricing is difficult to impossible. There is the 30 day tourist visa and 1-year and 5 year options. There is NO page on any Indian government site listing all the options and the price for each one so visitors can choose and then go apply. I'm sure people will post links below to dispute this but, go ahead, post, and I'll tell you why that page is crap. **Crap design is not an accident, it's a feature built into the Indian visa applications.**
2. Indian visa applications ask the most ridiculous and completely idiotic questions. They are a masterclass in nonsense and demand unnecessary and totally useless data. Bureaucracy for bureaucracy sake! My parents died 50 years ago but the visa application demands father and mother's name, nationality, place of birth and what not. If you do not have that information - say you are an orphan or something - you cannot complete the application as those are all mandatory fields! There is also no option to mark parents as ""deceased"" or ""late"".
3. The form asks for a national ID number. Maybe Indians have been forced to comply with that Aadhar nonsense (and all the problems associated with it - from breaches of data to the poorest people being excluded from government services), but in the UK we have always resisted any National ID. There are other countries where there is no national ID. So the national ID field being a compulsory field in the visa application is stupid. Was it the intention to exclude all visitors from countries where there is no National ID? Probably not! So why is this a compulsory question?
4. You have to choose a religion! Why? But okay, they want it (maybe just to do more detailed checks on Muslims). However, there is no option for Atheist. So, basically, unless one subscribes to some imaginary being in the sky, one can't enter India? The closest option is ""Other"" but I don't have an ""other"" religion. I have NO religion. There is no option for that. The assumption is that everyone has a religion (pretty stupid!)
5. Another compulsory field is name, phone number etc of someone in India who can serve as a ""reference"". And, guess what? One's not enough. You need two! And you need to provide full details for BOTH of them. FFS!
6. There's a question about whether I've ever visited India before. If I choose ""yes"", I've got to provide all kinds of information like the visa number I was issued at the time. But I didn't need a visa back then when I visited a decade go, I had an Indian passport (despite having been a British resident for 30 years). I have a British passport now but this is the first visit to India on the British passport. They don't seem to have accounted for situations like this. So I had to say ""No"" to the question about whether I ever visited India (which, technically, is untrue, but I can't proceed with the application unless I provide that answer).
7. There is one field that asks if your grandparents were ever Pakistani (!). If you choose no and save the form, when you return to it, it defaults back to ""yes"" automatically. All other inputted data stays the same (a small blessing) but this field changes (sometimes, not always!)!

It takes someone exceptionally stupid to design a form like this one!

And this visa application rigmarole is against a backdrop where most countries just give us a visa on arrival. Even countries famous for bureaucracy, like the Philippines, don't ask for all this bullsh\*t.

Why is India so awkward and how many visitors is India's tourism sector losing because of the unnecessary detail demanded in the visa application form?

I expect this post to get downvoted, so do go ahead, but it would be even better if you display more intelligence than the form designers and explain **why** you disagree with me (or what justification there is for any of the above).

<added: Just for clarity, all of the above is in relation to applying for an e-visa. I'm adding this because several people seem to be suggesting that I apply for an e-visa. 

One more thing - the solution of going OCI, like several have suggested, is even more cumbersome, difficult, time consuming and expensive (it costs 5x as much). Besides, applying for an OCI to make a single trip for a couple of weeks ...is overkill. It's more suited to those who visit India on a regular basis.>",1245,279,2025-10-15,ForAllTimesSake,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1o77miz/the_application_process_for_a_foreigner_to_get_an/

india,month,The racism Indians are facing abroad is our karma,"Our entire culture revolves around pushing the next person down for being from a lower caste, for being from South India, for being darker, for being poorer, or any signifier one can find to dehumanize someone for. We are constantly talking crap about Black people, Arab people, and Chinese people, even though most of us have fuckall to do with them. We are hung up on the construct of status… all while our collective status is in the gutter on the world stage.

We are such an ego-driven culture and everything is about chasing the quick ego hit rather than ever trying to pursue longevity. Rather than look upwards and grow, we are constantly giving ourselves temporary ego boosts by looking downwards and deriving sadistic pleasure from seeing those that have less than us or lower social standing. We are ridiculously short-sighted and feed off of societal division, rather than ever see the bigger picture or think long-term. We look for someone smaller to use as a punching bag instead of working on ourselves. We would rather stroke our superiority complex than build actual superiority.

We were probably one of the easiest populations for Europeans to colonize, since we are so easily baited by quick ego hits. Our infighting and tribalism makes it beyond easy for a foreign power to come occupy us. We absolutely got our asses handed to us due to our cultural flaws. But even after this huge slap in the face, we never learned, and instead doubled down on our arrogant classism, casteism, and colorism. Dehumanization is always demonic, even when people try and justify it through “religion”.

I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve been at family or friend gatherings and saw all the potbellied uncles sit in the living room and talk trash about some demographic of their choosing to feel better about themselves. They are busy punching down and jerking their egos off while the world evolves. Arrogance, ignorance, and gossip are all coping mechanisms for India’s countless losers.

Our culture has no humility, no growth mindset, no empathy, and no bravery to stare our shortcomings in the face. It is absolute low-testosterone, low-IQ behavior to create and uphold a division-centric culture that is a sitting duck for any outside forces. I feel sorry for all the young people born into this trainwreck that never signed up to be a part of it, who now have to pay the toll for the culture’s overall failure.

A big, fat mirror is being held up to our culture and maybe it’s time to finally reckon with it. Perhaps it is India’s karma that our people are now being faced with surging racism abroad. Racists are well aware of our casteism and colorism, and exploit that fact to rationalize their mistreatment of us. We are one of the most embarrassing demographics now, despite having some of the brightest individuals among us. What goes around comes around, I guess. Our culture has let us down.",385,337,2025-10-21,psycwave,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ocij32/the_racism_indians_are_facing_abroad_is_our_karma/
india,month,Why is it that many people in India still struggle to grasp the idea of quality of life?,"Having spent a good chunk of my life in military stations, I think that’s why the outside world feels so overwhelming to me. Life inside a cantonment is… well, it’s a different ball game. The roads are spotless, traffic flows smoothly, dogs are vaccinated and well-behaved, garbage gets picked up every day, and there’s this unspoken respect among everyone. Kids can play freely in the streets, officers and jawans exchange polite greetings, and there’s a certain rhythm to life — calm, orderly, and dignified.

But then you step outside those gates — into what we call “civil life” — and it’s like you’ve landed on another planet.

It’s as if people here have made chaos their default mode. Traffic jams are so common that folks have started scheduling their days around them. Pedestrians stroll on the roads as if they have nine lives, while drivers honk like the horn is a magic button that gives them extra speed.

Driving here isn’t just about getting from point A to B; it’s a battle for survival. Everyone’s in a hurry, yet no one seems to be making any real progress. Lane discipline? That’s just a fairy tale. Red lights? Optional. Zebra crossings? Merely a suggestion.

And the police? They seem completely unfazed. They’ll stop a 17-year-old on a scooter to check for a “license and RC,” but won’t bat an eye when an overloaded government bus swerves across three lanes, nearly causing an accident.

As for auto drivers? They navigate the roads like they’re on a suicide mission, probably with some political backing.

And heaven help you if a VIP decides to take your route — suddenly, your time, your frustration, your fuel, and your sanity don’t matter at all. Roads get blocked, police are stationed every few meters, and you find yourself stuck in traffic while some politician waves from an air-conditioned car, trying to show how much he “cares for the people.”

It’s astonishing how people can keep their homes spotless yet treat public spaces like they’re personal trash cans. You’ll see someone sweeping their doorstep in the morning, only to toss their garbage right on the corner of the same street.

Street dogs and cows wander around, munching on plastic and garbage. Dead animals lie unattended for days, while people stroll by as if it’s just part of the landscape.

And then you’ll hear someone chime in, “India is a spiritual country.”

Sure, spiritual — but seems to have a serious allergy to responsibility.

Every few weeks, there’s something that clogs up the roads:

A political rally where the leader talks about progress while his event literally brings the city to a standstill.

A visarjan or baraat that turns the streets into dance floors.

A festival where people set off firecrackers like they’re declaring war on the environment.

After Diwali, the AQI skyrockets to 400+, and suddenly everyone’s an environmentalist on Twitter — “why only question our religion?” — while they’re coughing their lungs out the next morning.

Come on, the planet doesn’t care about your religion. It just knows you set off 10,000 bombs for “fun.”

Why is everyone so angry all the time?

You accidentally bump into someone — boom, they’re ready to throw down. You politely ask someone to move their car — instant verbal assault.

Thank goodness India doesn’t have gun laws like America. If we did, there’d be daily shootouts at every traffic light.

And the hypocrisy? Off the charts.

People will spit, pee, and toss trash in public like it’s their birthright — but lose their minds if they see a woman in shorts or a couple holding hands.

They act like public decency is about controlling others, not themselves.

And don’t even get me started on the older men.

The same guys who strip down in railway waiting rooms like it’s their personal bedroom will suddenly become the moral police if a young couple buys condoms.

“Sharam nahi aati?”

No uncle, the only shameful thing here is your sense of entitlement.

These are the same uncles who’ll watch item songs with their buddies but start quoting “Indian culture” the moment a woman walks by in jeans.

The idea of Quality of Life isn’t just a fancy concept from the West — it’s a fundamental aspect of being human. It’s about having access to clean air, safe streets, and a life free from constant noise, dirt, or hostility.

It’s about living in a society where:

Traffic rules are taken seriously.

Police serve the community with fairness.

Celebrities aren’t put on a pedestal.

Festivals don’t harm the environment.

Public areas are treated with the same respect as private ones.

In India, many people mistake “adjust kar lo” for resilience. But it’s not; it’s a sign of apathy. We’ve been adjusting for so long that we’ve lost sight of what it truly means to live well.",672,111,2025-10-31,EntryFuture3882,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1okmkz1/why_is_it_that_many_people_in_india_still/
india,month,Indian professor exposes the hypocrisy: Western countries that freely migrated for centuries now restrict Indians while lecturing us about not signing the refugee convention,"Western countries are tightening restrictions on Indian students and workers, there are literal protests in Europe against refugees from countries they themselves destabilized, and somehow we still get lectured about not signing the 1951 Refugee Convention.

An Indian legal scholar has just published a detailed takedown of this hypocrisy that's worth understanding. Professor B.S. Chimni, India's leading scholar on Third World Approach to International Law has an article in the Journal of Refugee Studies that lays out some historical facts that rarely get mentioned when Westerners talk about migration.

Between 1850 and 1920, about 40 million Europeans left for other continents and went to Americas, Australia, even parts of Africa and Asia. They often just took land from indigenous people and settled there, no visas, no point based systems, no questions asked. That was a massive percentage of Europe's population moving around completely freely without any restrictions.

Now, if we put this in today's context and if people from developing countries including India had migrated at that same rate since World War II, roughly 800 million people would have moved to wealthier countries. Instead, only 0.8% of the developing world's workforce has migrated to industrialized nations which is one twentieth the European rate.

And yet when even this tiny fraction tries to move for education or work, we face increasingly harsh restrictions. UK keeps changing visa rules for Indian students,Canada just cut immigration targets with Australia tightening skilled migration and Trump less we speak, the better. Interesting to note that Trump's own grandfather was a German immigrant and he himself doesn't have very old US lineage to spew such nonsense on immigration, anyway, I digrees, moving on..

During the colonial period, European powers also moved between 12 and 37 million people from colonized regions as indentured labor. They extracted resources, destabilized local economies, and created conditions that still drive migration today. By 1770, nearly 2.5 million enslaved people in the Americas were producing a third of total European commerce value, but now immigration is a crisis for them.

Chimni points out something even more relevant to recent events. Many major refugee situations in the last few decades happened because of Western military interventions. Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria. These countries were destabilized directly by Western policies. And now refugees from these places face closed doors and literal protests when trying to reach the very nations whose bombs destroyed their homes.

There are protests in Europe against Syrian refugees. Think about that, the very same US and European countries participated in interventions that contributed to Syria's destruction, and now there are protests against people fleeing that destruction trying to reach safety. And then, with all this history, with all this hypocrisy, we get questioned about why India hasn't signed the 1951 Refugee Convention.

Let's be clear about that this convention was written in 1951, literally during the colonial era when most of the Global South was still colonized or just gaining independence. During the Cold War, Western countries used it generously to accept refugees from communist nations because it served their geopolitical interests and it was proof that the other side's system was failing. Then the Cold War ended and refugee flows started coming from developing countries to developed ones. Suddenly the same treaty became the basis for keeping people out. The legal text didn't change but what changed was who was seeking refuge and whether accepting them benefited powerful countries.

Now the convention is used as a tool of containment with western countries haveing built what scholars call a non entree regime, basically a system of barriers to prevent refugees from even reaching their territory to claim protection. They externalize border controls, they pay other countries to hold refugees, they use technology to keep people out.

And somehow we're supposed to sign up for this? We're supposed to take on legal obligations under a system designed during colonialism, that Western countries themselves don't meaningfully follow anymore, while they restrict our citizens from coming to their countries for legitimate purposes?

Chimni's article documents that only 7% of academic research about refugees comes from scholars in developing countries, even though 80% of refugees live here. The entire field is dominated by Western universities that focus on what's happening in Western countries and systematically exclude perspectives from regions that actually host most refugees.

India already hosts refugees. We have Tibetans, Sri Lankan Tamils, Afghans, Rohingya, and others. We do this without being party to the convention, based on our own traditions and policies. We're not perfect, there are issues with how some groups are treated, but we're not the ones going around destabilizing other countries and then refusing to take responsibility for the displacement we caused.

The article makes clear that the current system serves Western interests. When it was convenient during the Cold War, refugees were welcome. and now that it's inconvenient, the same legal framework is used to keep them out. Meanwhile, Western countries whose policies directly created refugee crises face minimal responsibility for the consequences.

And yet somehow the conversation is always about what developing countries should be doing, never about the historical responsibility of countries that colonized half the world, that extracted resources for centuries, that intervened militarily in dozens of countries, and that benefited from migration freedom when it suited them.

Update 1 - A lot of people are thinking this post implies the article or I am advocating that Western countries should take Indians or other immigrants without conditions or restrictions. That's not the idea. The paper clearly states that 80% of refugees live in the Global South. For example, when Afghanistan was ravaged by American intervention, Afghans didn't fly directly to Washington. They took refuge in neighboring countries like India and still live here. But who created the mess? The US did.

Yet if you talk to the US and other Western countries, they lecture India about how we should sign the refugee convention or its protocol like them, and how we're a terrible nation for not doing so. This despite the fact we've hosted Tibetans, Afghans, Rohingyas, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans and others in times of crisis. This is the hypocrisy of the West, not one country in particular but their collective stand on the issue.",695,111,2025-10-18,Super_Presentation14,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1o9qe84/indian_professor_exposes_the_hypocrisy_western/
india,month,The Indian without an identity.,"I was born in Dubai and lived there for 30 years. Then got fed up because I really didn't feel like I belong there and other than making lots of tax free money, you don't get citizenship and you are a second class citizen. So I left to India(Bangalore) with my wife in 2015 to start fresh. Thought I would try to make it in my own country instead. The 2.5 years I spent there was just a culture shock for me and I wasn't getting offered more than 20000 INR salary because I was supposedly a fresher in India and people laughed at me when I demanded a higher salary. I used to work as a project manager in Dubai. So I Thought fuck it, taught myself programming by making android games and took a loan, applied for a 6 month German language course in Germany and came to Germany in 2018 to try my luck. Within 4 months I got a job as an e learning developer with a good salary and got a residence visa for me and my wife(mind you I had no prior experience working for anyone as a software developer). The only experience I had to show was an Indian android game i made in 2016 called Boom Shiva which has about 200,000 downloads(it's removed from the app store now because I didn't update it).

Still here in Germany after 8 years and even though I have gone through many ups and downs I think it was the best decision I ever made. I found stability and safety. Finally had a child last year(we had earlier decided we would not have kids but this stability gave us the option to think about having a child).

Do I miss India? Of course! I miss the human connection which i don't have here. Our social life is bound to just us. I wish everyday that India was a better place so I can finally move back and stop feeling like an outsider everywhere. But then again that future seems bleak. So I am just going to be a global citizen. Live my life globally. And visit India whenever I can. Over the years I have lost my identity. I don't really know what I can do to make my country better for myself because it's too overwhelming when you think about all the issues there. I am still Indian at heart. And I don't really know how much longer Germany or other countries will be cool with Indians because there's already a lot of hate rising because of the massive amounts of migration. 

I'm not giving up. I will do something to contribute to making India a better place to live, at least in the future for my daughter. I may be no one. But I still believe that I can make that change. I think about it every day and have many plans. It may seem delusional, but that's the one thing keeping me going. 

The frustration that I can't live and belong in my own country breaks my heart. I see the Germans enjoying their homeland and I feel jealous. I wish I could feel like that about my own country. 

Maybe some day in the future. Today I will just dream of inventing something significant that will change my country for the better. But in the back of my mind I know the truth. One person will not be able change anything. But if a lot of us think together and plan together and become a collective of millions who are determined to make India a better place, maybe our strength in numbers can bring about that change. Maybe. I won't give up. Because I want that future for my daughter. I want her to be proud of being an Indian. There is so much depth to what India is. But it gets lost in the crowd of corruption, religion and everyone just looking out for their own immediate future and not the country as a whole.

Edit: there are more than a billion of us. The strongest collective group on the world. The whole world shits on India and Indians and mocks us wherever we are,and we take it because we are made to believe that we are worthless, that we need to fight every for approval, for survival. All this because of some bad actors within the country and some scammers trying to scam the world. Those bad actors account for maybe 10% of the population. The rest of us either integrate elsewhere and lay low, or live in poverty in our own country and have zero value given to our lives. If we start thinking as a collective we are the strongest force on this planet. If we stop saying "" fuck this country, it can't change"" and instead think ""fuck the world, I am Indian and I will join my fellow Indians in making my country the strongest in the world""...there is nothing that can stop us. Think about it. 

Edit 0: I love Germany. It's a great place to live. Everything is amazing here. I haven't faced too much racism either. I owe this place a lot. And I will always be grateful to this country for giving me opportunities no other country including India gave me. Just making that clear :). But it is not my homeland.

Edit 1: I just meant I won't apply for german citizenship. My wife probably will. And I will do so for my daughter too because why not have a dual citizenship. She can choose what she wants to be later in life. I am not imposing anything on my family. I purely spoke my own truth. Please stop misunderstanding me :)

Edit 2: from a lot of the comments, I guess I was wrong to say that I want to keep my identity as Indian(please sense the sarcasm :D). I love Germany for all it has given me. But I didn't know it was wrong to feel like I wish I could make India a better place so that I could live there too when I want and however long I want. I am a very social person and it's not hard for me to make friends in any country. Because I have lived abroad most of my life abroad and have interacted with ethnicities from all over the world. I don't think a German would get so much hate for wanting to keep their German identity. 

Last Edit for today(have to cook dinner): I have integrated pretty well in Germany. I have created many mental health websites by teaming up with psychologists and neurologists here that have helped thousands of Germans get mental health therapy digitally because it's hard to get in person appointments here. I have a YouTube channel that has videos in German and English and Indian languages. I speak fluent german. And I respect every countries culture and rules and regulations. This is not about difficulty integrating. These are just my heartfelt thoughts.

india,month,Why vote chori will never gain public momentum.,"If you understand Indian elections, then it's not only the ruling party netas which make money. , even someone who has never won an election can make good money as being in public life itself is a headstart for many.

No one will go on boycotting elections as contesting in elections even if you are losing is very important for a lot of on ground politicians as it is their bread and butter.

Let me gave you a real life example of my friend.

Started off as collecting donations for Ganpati Pandal and hosting cricket tournaments, slowly steadily leveraged his caste and slum background  and became a leader of the area. , started contesting councillor  elections as an independent . Got 600 votes and lost badly, but now it was confirmed that he can get or transfer these much votes and he has hold in the area., he used that during MP and MLA elections.I think each elections he use to easily make 20 lakhs plus.

But his main income source is from doing government work and extortion through RTI , right from getting a liquor license to making a 2nd floor slum., he will do work for everything . If work not done due to xyz reasons , he was  thick skinned and will never return the money., having an army of 15-30 supporters means he cannot be physically harmed so easily. Any matter in local police station or municipality he can help provided the expenses are taken care of. , he doesn't take money from everyone as ""jisko dega uski Nahi lega"". The giving or dega crowd is his core supporters and the lega crowd are different category.

He has contested each municipal elections and even the MLA elections ., he knows he cannot win but being in public life gives him the required access and his main source of income as RTI extortionist .

Being filing RTIs, I have come to understand that if you have a nuisance capability (lawyer, politician, journalist), you can make a lot of money here.

There are many such characters in whole of India right from gram Panchayat to South Mumbai, all of them cannot boycott elections claiming it is rigged and when opposition cannot boycott elections it means they believe in the democratic process.

Edit :.

Many did not get what I am trying to say In India, even losing elections pays — local politicians earn influence, access, and income just by contesting. That’s why “vote chori” will never spark mass boycotts. In countries like Bangladesh, Venezuela, or Zimbabwe, the opposition gains nothing from rigged polls, so they walk away — in India, they stay in.


In India, whenever people have hit the streets — like during the farmers’ protest or the SC-ST Act agitation — it’s usually the local rung leaders who mobilize the crowds and coordinate the action. These same grassroots leaders, however, won’t protest or boycott elections over “vote chori”, because elections themselves are their source of power, money, and visibility. The system, even if flawed, sustains them — so they’ll never tear it down.",378,69,2025-11-06,Llyodscoffeehouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1oq07xn/why_vote_chori_will_never_gain_public_momentum/

The fear-mongering started with this tweet: https://x.com/NicHulscher/status/1982895909668302992

The author claims that they have done a meta-analysis of over 300 studies to conclude that vaccinations are the dominant risk factor for Autism.

**Remember, [vaccines do not cause autism](https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-safe-and-effect-no-link-to-autism)**

---

### The ""Study""

The story lists **Andrew Wakefield** and **Peter A. McCullough** as co-authors, and both had their medical licenses revoked for unethical practices and promoting conspiracy theories about vaccines. 

**Andrew Wakefield is the author of the infamous and 1998 paper (that was later retracted) that proposed a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.** His license was later revoked, and he has since dedicated his life to peddling conspiracy theories about vaccines. 

**Why was Wakefield's study fraudulent?** [An investigation by Sunday Times reporter Brian Deer](https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347) revealed undisclosed financial conflicts of interest - Wakefield reportedly stood to earn up to $43 million per year selling test kits. The General Medical Council also found that he had not disclosed funding from lawyers suing vaccine manufacturers. The publicity surrounding his study caused a sharp decline in vaccination uptake, leading to outbreaks of measles around the world and many preventable deaths.

**Recommended reading: [One paper, 20 years of damage](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/medicine-access/one-paper-twenty-years-of-damage/89422527)**

**Peter A. McCullough is a former cardiologist [who had his license revoked](https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/features/113624) after he continuously peddled misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine.** While he still technically holds medical licenses in Texas and Michigan, the loss of board certification significantly impacts his ability to practice in hospitals and with insurance networks.

---

### The Evidence Against the Vaccine-Autism Link is Overwhelming

Since Wakefield's fraudulent study, approximately 20 other studies have been conducted by different researchers, in different populations, and in different countries - and every single one has found no association between vaccines and autism.

[A comprehensive 2014 meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/) included five cohort studies involving 1,256,407 children and five case-control studies involving 9,920 children. The conclusion? Vaccinations are not associated with the development of autism or autism spectrum disorder, and vaccine components (thimerosal or mercury) or multiple vaccines (MMR) are not associated with autism development.

### Vembu's Scientific Opinions

Sridhar Vembu jumped onto this bandwagon with this tweet. 

>[Parents should take this analysis seriously. **I believe there is increasing evidence that we are giving way too many vaccines to very young children.** This is spreading in India too and we are seeing a rapid increase in autism in India.](https://x.com/svembu/status/1982997965234155949)

He was subsequently called out by Dr. Amit Gupta (Clinical Lead for Neonatal Care, John Radcliffe Hospital , Oxford)

>This is utterly irresponsible. Luckily people dont listen to folk like you otherwise we would have a infectious disease crisis on our hands

To this, Vembu's response is amusing. 

>You are a hyper specialist in neo-natal care. You cannot possibly _scientifically_ know all the _long term_ effects of every shot we give young babies because you do not clinically see those neo-natal babies once they grow out of that stage.

>Please cultivate an open curious mind doctor - professional arrogance arising from your institutional pedigree is completely unbecoming of a scientist.

>Your kind of hyper-specialization is itself a serious crisis in medicine today.


When Andrew Wakefield's past was brought up, this is what Vembu had to say. 

>**I have met Dr Andy Wakefield and he is not a fraud.** I have personally known very good doctors who have an excellent research record who respect Dr Wakefield and feel sad about what was done to him. They seriously question the medical system going dangerously off course.

>Covid vaccines have become quite unpopular in America now. Dr McCullough caught that early and paid the price for it.

>These doctors are not frauds. They are brave warriors and deserve our gratitude.

This is absolutely insane. Andrew Wakefield is a proven fraudster, that's why his paper and credentials were revoked. It seems that Vembu has drunk the same cool-aid that vaccine sceptics in the US have been drinking for two decades. 

**These are the type of tweets he is retweeting.**

>**My son diagnosed with Autism at the age of 3, our lives became upside down. As a father I know, vaccines caused its, he was all fine till 3 years, post these MMR and related vaccines he declined. I dont want this to happen to any other kid, I will fight till my last breath**

### Why Parents Think Vaccines Cause Autism: Understanding the Timing

This perceived connection has been debunked multiple times. Here's why parents often make this incorrect association:

[**Professionals like pediatricians identify autism by carefully reviewing a child’s medical, social, family and developmental histories along with directly observing the child’s behaviors. Autism is often first identified in children between 12 and 24 months. This corresponds to many developmental milestones and temporally corresponds to key childhood vaccines giving some the false impression of a linkage between autism and vaccines. **](https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-safe-and-effect-no-link-to-autism)

Additionally, many children show symptoms of autism by 12 to 18 months of age or earlier. Importantly, some children with autism regress - meaning they stop using language, play, or social skills they've already learned. This regression may happen between ages 1 and 2 years. Some children with ASD gain new skills and meet developmental milestones until around 18 to 24 months of age, and then they stop gaining new skills or lose the skills they once had.

This is why parents notice changes after vaccination - it's not because vaccines caused autism, but because autism symptoms naturally emerge during the same developmental period when vaccines are administered.

india,month,"Parents looking to enroll their children in international curriculum schools, please go through this. I know it's long but it will give you a fresh perspective from the eyes of someone who has studied in them.","**pretext about me:** 

I am a student who recently completed college, and I was a part of multiple boards throughout my schooling (from 1st to 12th). I've been a part of the Cambridge board, CBSE, and also the state board for my 11th and 12th grades. I have friends who moved to IBDP programs as well. 

The reason I am posting this here is that lately, especially after 2016-17, I have seen parents who go out of their way to pay for their kids schooling and no this isn't really correct, as, believe me the expensive schools didnt really add anything into my life infact they made my ability to study even worse, it went downhill. 

I, as a student, always felt IGCSE was kinda overrated and CBSE was alright but it didnt have enough depth in the subject. I heard CBSE has made the syllabus even easier for the batches post 2020, the most I have learnt and actually been exposed to real competition was when I got into the state board for 11th and 12th, they had a completely differnt approach to studying and the competiton there felt like i was pushed out of the bubble i grew up in when i was in school up until 10th grade. I always liked science when i was in school but i only learnt how student of science and math actually are when i was exposed to the other people in the class in the state board, such brillint minds, these dudes already knew what sets and limits were from their 9th and 10th grade they already know IUPAC nomenclatures, they already knew not only the physics concepts i knew but they also knew how they can be applied and how they can be worked on and be visualised. they could grasp everything so easily as if a cotton ball absorbing water(many students in my class alone scored over 90-95 percent in the final exams and also ended up in iits, nits sadly i couldnt make it because it took me quite sometime to adjust to the competition),

 I was amazed to see even an average student of this class can overtake a top 10 student from my school and mind you these were students from normal schools with very affordable fee structure and they were mainly from english medium state board schools, there were a few students from telugu medium too(these students from telugu medium found english medium a bit troublesome in the start but they coped up well and even they had good knowlegde on science and math), and when my friend who went to IB school for DP programme and when she met me after two years, she could clearly see the differences in adapting to the competition levels between me and her. i am not dissing ib programs, they are good and intensive too but according to her they arent really subject intensive but they are intensive in terms of workload and no way they prepare you to compete for college in india. and if you really wanna go out of the country you are eligible no matter the board and in 12th i took both sat, sat 2 (sat subject test has been discontinued in 2021) and act tests which felt very easy to me when compared to what i have prepared for in 11th and 12th. 

My grilfriend who has studied in state board all her life in a small town ended up being one of the toppers of our college and she barely even studied for the exams, and now she is preparing for exams so i have seen many students of our state board and one thing i have observed is these students can adapt to anything, like these people are built to compete. where i was struggling to clear exams my girlfriend was breezing through them all the while preparing for upsc and also giving CMAUSA exams with barely any preparation but she cleared CMAUSA in the first attempt(her whole schooling didnt even cost as much as my primary schooling let alone whole primary schooling i dont think it costed more than three of my school year fees combined and college(because she got scholorships for college due to academic excellence in the entrence test) and said it was super easy when i have have personally seen a couple of my school friends who are in finance struggle with the same papers. These people have adaptability in them. They can switch seamlessly between something analytical like science, mathematics, and engineering to rote-based learning subjects like remembering dates and names related upsc syllabus books and they can completely pick up a new subject and become really good at it within a few months, because they not only mug up and retain information but they have the ability understand a subject and replicate not only the exact information but also its application based questions (even many arts subjects this is exactly what exams like upsc or even masters level courses expect from one), this lacks in many of us from schools like mine i am not saying everyone is like that there are people academically brilliant in my school too but the top there and here are extremely different and the average there sucks when compared to average here.

And these exact schools lately have become even worse and pretentious to a point where i dont even see kids from these schools talk in mother tongue anymore and they find it cringe like schools are encouraging them to talk in pretentious western accent of english and even parents are doing the same, this has turned into a cult thats brainwashing everyone and creating FOMO to extract money from parents.

india,month,"India's Bridge Collapse Scam: Same Contractors Build Bad Roads and Bridges, They Fall Down, and They Get New Jobs Again","Edit: This is the first part of the post.

I've been researching bridge and road collapses in India over the last 5 years and discovered a disturbing pattern - it's literally a tender scam where contractors build cheap quality infrastructure, it collapses, and they get fresh contracts to rebuild or work on other projects. Let me break this down.

**The Scale of the Problem**

Between 2020-2025, India has witnessed an alarming number of bridge collapses. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari reported 55 cases of collapses or damages on NHAI roads, bridges, and tunnels over five years - 40 during construction and 15 on completed projects.
 (https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/55-instances-of-collapse-damage-on-nhai-roads-bridges-tunnels-in-5yrs-gadkari-101753886591588.html)

But media reports suggest the real number is much higher - 170 collapses with 202 deaths over just four years, indicating massive underreporting. 

(https://www.newslaundry.com/2025/07/29/4-years-170-collapses-202-deaths-whats-ailing-indias-bridges) 

A 2020 study found that 2,130 bridges collapsed in India between 1977 and 2017. 

**Major Collapses in Recent Years**

Gujarat's Gambhira Bridge in Vadodara collapsed on July 9, 2025, killing 22 people when vehicles plunged into the Mahi River. The 40-year-old bridge had shown structural decay for years, yet remained operational. Locals reported it shook dangerously when vehicles crossed, but authorities kept it open to traffic. 

The Morbi Suspension Bridge collapse on October 30, 2022 killed 135 people. Investigation revealed broken wires, faulty welding, and improper renovation. The contractor replaced wooden planks with aluminum sheeting without proper testing. 

Gujarat has witnessed 17 structural failures over five years total. 

Bihar saw 12 bridges collapse within just 20 days in 2024. 

The Indrayani River bridge near Pune collapsed on June 15, 2025, killing four people and injuring 18. Grants for replacement had been approved the previous year, but work orders were issued only after 18 months. 

**Now Here's Where It Gets Really Disturbing - The Contractor Tender Game**

**Ranjit Buildcon - Ahmedabad**

Ranjit Buildcon built the Mumatpura flyover in Ahmedabad that collapsed on December 21, 2021. AUDA suspended the company and proposed debarring them for three years. But here's the kicker - after floating tenders twice with no bidders, AUDA gave the exact same company the contract to complete the collapsed bridge. The ₹82 crore project was handed back to Ranjit Buildcon despite the investigation committee not even submitting its final report.

This was the THIRD incident involving Ranjit Buildcon - earlier bridge projects in Surat in 2007 also witnessed accidents where one person died.
 (https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/collapse-of-ahmedabad-flyover-third-incident-involving-same-company-7687752/) 

Despite this track record, the company continues handling major projects for Vadodara, Rajkot, Surat civic bodies, and the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar Metro Rail. Media reports describe Ranjit Buildcon as Gujarat government's ""favourite contractor"".
 
**SP Singla Construction - Bihar**

SP Singla Construction built the Aguwani-Sultanganj bridge over the Ganga in Bhagalpur district at a ₹1,710 crore cost. The bridge collapsed TWICE - first on April 30, 2022, and again on June 4, 2023. 

Bihar issued a show-cause notice asking why the company shouldn't be blacklisted. But get this - SP Singla Construction continued operating on major projects in Gujarat during this entire period.
 (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/contractor-of-collapsed-bihar-bridge-building-two-in-gujarat/articleshow/100806076.cms) 

The company had already built bridges in Assam, and after the Bihar collapse, Assam CM ordered IIT inspections of their bridges, but the company remained active.

**GPC Infrastructure - Palanpur**

GPC Infrastructure was blacklisted by the BJP government in Gujarat in 2016-17 after one-third of a road they built got washed away during monsoon in Ahmedabad. Despite being blacklisted, the same company got a contract in 2021 to build the Palanpur bridge. That bridge collapsed on October 23, 2023, killing two people. Congress leader Amit Chavda alleged that GPC Infrastructure had contributed approximately ₹1 crore to the BJP's party fund before the 2019 election.
 (https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/palanpur-bridge-collapse-firm-blacklisted-2016-17-gujarat-congress-leader-amit-chavda-8999131/)

**Oreva Group - Morbi**

This one is absolutely insane. The Oreva Group was given the Morbi bridge renovation contract without any tender process at all. Oreva specializes in CFL bulbs, wall clocks, and e-bikes - they had ZERO experience in bridge construction.

A Bombay firm had bid for the contract at a lower price, but the district collector received a call to award it to Oreva despite their higher quote and lack of expertise. The Gujarat High Court even questioned why the operation and maintenance contract was given without floating a tender.

The company claimed they did ""100% renovation in ₹2 crore"" but didn't replace old cables and opened the bridge without a fitness certificate. The bridge collapsed killing 135 people.

As Congress leader Amit Chavda stated: ""Today in Gujarat, if you want to take up a contract for a road or bridge, as long as a commission is not sent to the Kamlam [BJP office], the contract is not awarded.""

**Why There's No Real Accountability**

Bihar suspended 16 engineers after 12 bridges collapsed in 20 days. But the Supreme Court criticized the government for reinstating suspended officers after public attention shifted.
 (https://www.deccanherald.com/india/bihar/bihar-bridge-collapses-officers-suspended-then-brought-back-observes-sc-3473956)

Such suspensions ""hardly act as a deterrent, as has been seen in the past. These suspensions are revoked after few weeks once media and public attention shifts."" Government sources admit such committees have never led to punishment of any official or contractor in the past.
 (https://latest.sundayguardianlive.com/news/bridge-collapse-in-bihar-exposes-commission-system)

Companies simply change names to bypass blacklisting. S N Bhobe & Associates was blacklisted by Surat Municipal Corporation after a flyover collapse, but within a month, the firm was demerged into TPF Engineering Private Limited with the same directors. TPF then won six Mumbai contracts.
 (https://indianexpress.com/article/india/under-new-name-firm-blacklisted-in-surat-won-six-mumbai-contracts-5739402/)

Despite 55 cases of collapses on NHAI roads, bridges, and tunnels, only TWO incidents resulted in disciplinary action - one project director was suspended and another transferred. That's it.

The Morbi case with 135 deaths remains without charges filed two years later. 

**The Mumatpura Case Reveals the Mechanism**

When AUDA floated tenders twice after the Mumatpura collapse, no bidders came forward because tender conditions required the new bidder to take responsibility for the entire bridge while only completing remaining construction. This makes re-awarding to the original contractor the ""easy"" option for officials.
 (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/barred-firm-to-complete-collapsed-flyover/articleshow/95870630.cms)

Additionally, contractors maintain political connections through donations and commissions that protect them from blacklisting. This creates a vicious cycle: corrupt tender awards → substandard construction due to commission system → collapse → same contractors get rebuild contracts → repeat.

**What Happens After Collapses**

Compensation is announced but often not fully paid. After the Gambhira Bridge collapse, Gujarat CM announced ₹4 lakh compensation for each deceased and ₹50,000 for the injured.
 (https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/gujarat-bridge-collapse-gambhira-bridge-vehicles-fell-one-after-another-fisherman-on-moments-after-bridge-broke-8848187)

For Morbi, the Gujarat High Court ordered Oreva to pay ₹10 lakh interim compensation to each deceased's family and ₹2 lakh to the injured, but the company struggled to pay even 50% of the interim amount.
 (https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/deposited-50-of-interim-compensation-for-morbi-bridge-victims-oreva-in-hc-123032700588_1.html)

Bihar finally rolled out a bridge maintenance policy after 10 years in development, requiring departments to maintain ""health cards"" with detailed inspection records for all 6,200 bridges. But this was only done after repeated collapses forced their hand.
 
**The Bottom Line**

This is a full-blown infrastructure scam running across multiple states. The same contractors who build substandard bridges get fresh tenders after collapses because of political connections, commission systems, and deliberate lack of accountability. Hundreds have died, investigations go nowhere, suspensions are reversed, blacklisting is bypassed by changing company names, and the cycle continues.

The system is designed to benefit contractors and politicians while putting public lives at risk. Until there's genuine enforcement of blacklisting, independent audits, criminal prosecution, and breaking the commission system, this will keep happening.",536,31,2025-10-17,Critical-Fall-8212,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1o8wrdt/indias_bridge_collapse_scam_same_contractors/

india,month,How do contractors become so powerful in our country?,"On an emergency visit to the hospital, I saw a young boy probably 18 to 22 years old, his sister and his mother. The boy was in a strecher and unconscious. From their clothes I can figure out that they are poor. I initially think must be a road accident that happened due to food delivery. Then they start describing what happens and it makes me excessively numb.

Basically, the boy is a daily wage worker doing jobs in construction. He has been working for this contractor for the last 6 months and he hadn't been paid. Obviously he went to ask for money from the contractor multiple times but was rejected. On this occasion when he asked for money again and rallied multiple people to ask for money, the contractor asked once of his muscle hires to take care of the situation. The result was this guy hitting the skull of this boy with a bamboo and threatened others of similar action. At this point it becomes clear that this is a police case. Thankfully the staff takes immediate action and are able to revive the guy from consciousness. I see the pillow is covered with blood and the sister and the mom are crying. I don't know what happens next but I see the boy being wheel chaired out of the hospital. He seems better but clearly multiple tests are needed to clear out everything. Atleast he is alive and was able to speak.

It got me thinking that India is so so far away from being developed. I think some of the top percentile people have no idea what reality of life is here. Additionally it got me thinking how these contractors become so powerful. This boy could have lost his life today. We routinely hear of corruption in infrastructure.

How have we allowed this. When did we become this country. Or maybe we have always been this way. Regardless, I got extremely disturbed with this incident and thought of sharing what I felt.

india,month,Disappointed salary-class Indian,"I've been really disturbed with the reality that hit me about the kind of treatment we salary-class folks get in this country. Every entity tries to take advantage and make fool of us.

1. The govt making sure every penny I earn or spend is taxed, and while I'm fine with the concept of taxes what troubles me is there is no benefit or treatment for tax-payers. Rather, the taxes are either used during election campaigns to give freebies to poor or directly/indirectly routed to the pockets of the millionaires.
Healthcare, infra, education, tell me any social aspect where we're even decently well. And don't get me started on what we girl's face on a daily basis. All this when I'm abiding by the law and paying taxes in seven figures.

2. We're all well-aware of the working culture here in India. I've worked with an Indian company and with Indian office of an MNC too. And while the culture broadly is far better at MNCs, the ground-truth is pretty much the same. Bosses expect you to work till late night, treat you like they own you, you're not allowed to raise your concerns, and it's too stressful. Again, no protection during or after termination of employment, no matter whether I pay taxes or not.

3. Consumer protection in India is a joke. Companies like MMT, Livpure, and almost any other company make their own rules which is certain to fill their pockets no matter what. Moreover, there's hardly any way to connect to human representatives of most of these companies, and there's no easy way to even reach regulators to complain about this. Yes we have consumer helpline but personally my experience has been crappy there too, with zero satisfaction and only wasting my time. These companies leave you mid-way even if you're in an emergency, and there's no concept of fair compensation. And don't even get me started on this fee, that fee.

4. We know how demanding Indian parents can get. And they don't understand the concept of stress or me-time. It's just barging into their child's privacy as if they own that life.

5. The ground workers who help us in daily lives, like my house help, cook, driver, etc. show zero professionalism and always making excuses to either extract money or evade more work. Imagine me doing this at my workplace.

india,month,"India's Bridge Collapse Scam: Same Contractors Build Bad Roads and Bridges, They Fall Down, and They Get New Jobs Again - Loot Part 2","After researching bridge collapses, I dug deeper and found the actual scam that runs India's infrastructure sector. It's exactly like the Akshay Kumar movie Khatta Meetha - contractors give political donations (chanda), get tenders, build substandard work or deliberately keep roads bad, and get fresh tenders repeatedly. 

NOTE: Had to add some points from Electoral Bond scam here.

**The Electoral Bonds Scam Exposed Contractor-Political Nexus**

When the Supreme Court struck down electoral bonds as unconstitutional and forced data release, it exposed perhaps the biggest quid pro quo scam in independent India. The data revealed a direct ""corporate-political nexus"" where contractors gave donations and got government contracts in return. 

Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh called electoral bonds ""pre-paid"", ""post-paid"" and ""post-raid"" bribes, through which the central government had given Rs 3.8 lakh crore in projects and contracts to private companies in exchange for Rs 2,004 crore in donations to BJP. In 49 cases, Rs 62,000 crore in post-paid contracts/project approvals were given by the Centre or BJP-led state governments, for which Rs 580 crore in ""kickbacks"" in electoral bonds were given to the BJP within a three-month span.

Megha Engineering & Infrastructure Ltd (MEIL) alone gave Rs 670 crore to BJP over five years, making it the single largest donor to any party. Much of this came AFTER Income Tax raids on the company in October. The company defeated international bids and won the strategic Zoji-la Tunnel contract in Ladakh near China border. Union Minister Gadkari praised them in parliament saying ""Megha's bid saved the government Rs 5,000 crore."" 

But when political winds changed in Telangana before 2023 elections, MEIL's donation pattern changed too. The company bought more bonds and donated nearly Rs 100 crore to Congress (the favorite according to opinion polls), making MEIL among Congress's top donors. In December 2023, Congress was elected to power in Telangana.

Vedanta Ltd purchased bonds worth Rs 10 crore to be donated to Congress in July 2023. By November 2023, Vedanta was allowed to set up a mineral beneficiation plant in Karnataka. The cost of the project is estimated to be around Rs 225 crore. 

GVPR Engineers Ltd, a Hyderabad-based company, faced protests from local farmers while setting up a private port in Honnavar, coastal Karnataka. Subsequently, GVPR made political donations by purchasing bonds and donating Rs 5 crore to BJP and Congress. The company's subsidiary HPPL secured the contract for this port project under the Centre's Sagarmala project worth Rs 600 crore. Survey work commenced in January 2024. 

Bengaluru-based Prestige Developers bought Rs 30 crore worth of electoral bonds through its subsidiaries in April 2023. The recipient was BJP. Prestige Group acquired 62.5 acres of land in Indirapuram Extension, Ghaziabad, from the UP government (where BJP is in power).

**The ""Khatta Meetha"" Model - Deliberately Keeping Roads Bad**

Remember the Akshay Kumar movie where contractors deliberately add less cement in concrete mixture to built a roads to get repeat contracts? That's happening in real life across India. 

In Mumbai, six contractors named in BMC's road scam inquiry bagged Rs 4,259 crore out of Rs 4,600 crore total road contracts in just three years between November 2012 and May 2015. With less than a month's rainfall, more than 700 potholes were found on city roads. Some of these roads were even in the defect liability period - the guarantee period where contractors are supposed to repair at their own cost.

In Navi Mumbai, a road stretch from Dmart to Haware Mall Junction in Nerul East was repaired with a new asphalt layer just two months earlier in May 2024. The work cost nearly Rs 3 crore. Within two months, numerous potholes appeared on this site. As per PWD notification of 2017, asphalt roads must have a life guarantee of 15 years, while concrete roads should last at least 25 years. RTI activist Anarjit Chauhan said: ""This means that either the executive engineer is ignorant about the quality of the repaired road, or he or she is intentionally ignoring the poor quality of work done.""

**Jharkhand Road Deliberately Destroyed for Fresh Tender**

A viral video from Dumka, Jharkhand showed a perfectly good, recently built road being broken by JCB machines. The allegation is that the road was deliberately destroyed to get a fresh tender. 

A Reddit post from August 2025 stated: ""In Jharkhand, they've mastered a new SCAM — destroy a freshly built road, get a new tender, and pocket crores. The road that was just fine yesterday is now being torn apart. Why? Because there's more money in reconstruction than in maintenance."" 

Source: [Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Jharkhand/comments/1mm97lv/in_jharkhand_theyve_mastered_a_new_scam_destroy_a/)

**The Defect Liability Period Manipulation**

Here's how sophisticated this scam is. Every government contract has a Defect Liability Period (DLP) - typically 5 years for asphalt roads and 15 years for concrete roads. During this period, if the road develops defects, the contractor must repair it at their own expense. But officials and contractors collude to let this period expire without repairs, so a fresh tender worth crores can be issued for ""reconstruction.""

In Palwal, Haryana, residents and social workers exposed this scam and faced FIR for it. Activist Shantnu Thakur alleged: ""The PWD department is responsible for maintaining roads for five years. Instead of repairing the road, they allowed the period to lapse, so a new tender worth Rs 2.5 crore could be issued for reconstruction. This appears to be a way to pocket money again instead of fulfilling maintenance obligations."" Officials were delaying action even after multiple complaints from villagers since February 2022, claiming interlocking tiles and proper surfacing were not done according to contract, but still no corrective action was taken until activists visited their office.

In Pune, a Rs 25 lakh road project on Dnyandeep Colony Lane Number 1 developed cracks and damage within days of construction. Only after Karvenagar Citizens Forum filed a complaint did PMC issue notice to the contractor. Civic activist Vivek Velankar said: ""Ideally, PMC should have monitored the road's condition and issued the notice proactively. It's surprising that the civic body had to slap the notice after we filed the complaint."" Activist Tanmay Kanitkar said: ""Generally residents neglect the defect liability period clause mentioned in the contract of civic projects.""

After the Gambhira bridge collapse in Gujarat that killed 22 people, the state government issued notices to over 25 contractors falling within the Defect Liability Period who have been asked to repair 659 km of damaged roads across 17 municipal corporations. Sources stated this is the FIRST such massive campaign against contractors over road damages - meaning for years, the DLP was simply ignored.

**Contractors Show Their Power Through Boycott**

After BMC cracked down on contractors involved in the Rs 352 crore road repair scam, the contractor lobby showed their real power. BMC was unable to find a contractor to undertake annual pothole-filling work during monsoon. BMC invited tenders THREE times but received very poor response. In the third round, only one contractor showed interest for the island city, while none responded for eastern and western suburbs. That contractor's bid was over 45% above estimates, so BMC couldn't appoint him. 

Officials admitted that the contractor lobby was playing hardball by staying away from bidding for critical pothole-filling contracts to build pressure on the civic administration. With no response from contractors, BMC was forced to ask the pre-monsoon-work contractors to fill potholes during monsoon too, though officials weren't sure how sincerely they would carry out the job. 

Source: [IndianExpress](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/after-road-repair-scam-crackdown-bmc-finds-no-contractors-to-fill-potholes-during-rains-2857662/)

This is the same contractor cartel that pocketed Rs 4,259 crore in three years. When action was taken, they simply boycotted tenders, forcing BMC to give them work anyway.

Despite FIRs being registered against six contractors and two chief engineers being suspended, BMC was still set to pay Rs 324 crore to the same contractors mired in the road scam because work had to continue.

**The Complete Cycle - How It All Works**

Here's the complete business model (Correct me if I am wrong):

Step 1: Infrastructure company gives political donation (chanda) through electoral bonds or other means to ruling party - anywhere from Rs 5 crore to Rs 670 crore

Step 2: Company gets cherry-picked for government contracts worth 10-100 times their donation within weeks or months. Often ED/CBI/IT raids are dropped after donations.

Step 3: For every Rs 100 contract, Rs 15-25 goes to officials and politicians as commission to get payments released. This forces contractors to work with only 60-75% of budget.

Step 4: Contractors use substandard materials, skip proper engineering, and deliberately build poor quality infrastructure to maintain profit margins.

Step 5: Infrastructure collapses or develops defects within months. Roads get potholes, bridges show cracks.

Step 6: During Defect Liability Period, contractor and officials collude to NOT repair defects. They wait for DLP to expire.

Step 7: Once DLP expires, fresh tender is issued for ""reconstruction"" or ""major repairs"" - worth crores again.

Step 8: Same contractor or contractor cartel wins the fresh tender (after fresh donations if needed).

Step 9: If any investigation happens, contractors are suspended but later reinstated. FIRs are filed but cases don't conclude for years. Companies change names to bypass blacklisting.

Step 10: Meanwhile, contractor lobby shows power by boycotting tenders if pressure increases. Government is forced to give them work anyway.

Step 11: Repeat from Step 3.

The scale of Bihar's contractor-bureaucrat nexus is evident from 12 bridges collapsing in just 20 days in 2024, all built by contractors with political connections. 

Source: [IndianExpress](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/indrayani-to-vadodara-3-major-bridges-that-collapsed-in-2025-10115854/)

**The Bottom Line**

This is not corruption - this is a full-blown business model. Electoral bonds data proved what everyone knew - you give chanda, you get theka (contract), you build substandard work, it collapses or deteriorates, you get fresh theka. The contractor-politician-bureaucrat nexus ensures nobody gets punished, investigations go nowhere, and the same people keep getting richer while infrastructure keeps collapsing and killing people.

The Supreme Court struck down electoral bonds, but the business model continues through shell companies, cash donations, and other means. Until there's genuine enforcement, independent monitoring, citizen activism, and breaking this nexus, Indian taxpayers will keep paying for the same road to be built again and again while contractors and politicians split the loot.

**ENDING: A Message to Indian Youth - It's Time to Wake Up**

If you've read this far, you now know the truth. Every pothole you dodge, every bridge collapse you read about, every exam paper leak that destroys dreams - it's not incompetence. It's not bad luck. It's not ""that's just how India is.""

You pay taxes honestly. They steal it systematically. You follow rules. They change them for profit. You prepare for exams. They sell the papers. You drive on bad roads. They bank the money meant to fix them. You die in bridge collapses. 

And then they tell you India is developing. 

You have more power than you think. Mukesh Chandrakar was one journalist who exposed a Rs 120 crore scam before they killed him. But there are 70 crore youth in this country. They can't kill all of us. They can't silence all of us.

**The Choice Is Yours**, you can scroll past this post, feel angry for 5 minutes, and go back to life. Next year, another bridge will collapse. Your tax will fund the rebuild. The same contractor will get the tender. More people will die. More students will commit suicide. More journalists will be murdered. And you'll feel angry for 5 minutes again.

Or you can save this post. Share it with sources intact. File one RTI. Join one citizens' group. Support one independent journalist. Vote with knowledge. Speak up once when everyone is silent.

Your grandfather's generation fought the British and won freedom. Your father's generation stayed silent and lost it to corruption. Your generation has smartphones, internet, RTI, social media, and Supreme Court judgments on your side.

You're either going to be the generation that let India become a corporate-political loot machine, or the generation that said enough and fought back with facts, laws, and persistence. Mukesh Chandrakar died collecting evidence. Students are committing suicide. People are dying in bridge collapses. Your tax money is being stolen. 

What are you going to do about it? 

The choice has always been yours. Silence is also a choice. And they're counting on you to stay silent.  Don't....

india,month,Are We Witnessing the Consequences of Power in the Hands of the Incompetent?,"When you give too much power to those not competent enough to handle it, they eventually lose the plot.

For three consecutive national elections, the BJP government has swept to victory with overwhelming public support. But one has to ask, are they truly competent enough to handle the magnitude of power they now hold?

Look around. Propaganda films are being openly promoted. Media houses are increasingly subdued. Dissenters are jailed under the guise of law and order. Even institutions once trusted for their independence, from the Election Commission to the judiciary, now appear to operate under pressure.

Take recent examples:
• EPF accounts reportedly being frozen for months without explanation.
• Ethanol contracts allegedly benefiting connected families.
• Collapsing infrastructure in states like Maharashtra and Bihar.
• Tragedies in Sikkim or Kashmir barely making headlines because they do not bring enough seats.

This is not just governance gone wrong. It is arrogance bred by unchecked power.
When a government stops being questioned, it stops being accountable. And when accountability dies, democracy begins to decay.

Are we, as a nation, allowing this slow drift towards authoritarianism simply because it is wrapped in the language of nationalism and development?
Is this incompetence, delusion, or calculated control, the early signs of fascism?

I am not against strong leadership. I am even fine with a system where power is centralized if it truly brings results. But what we are witnessing feels like something darker, a government so convinced of its invincibility that it has forgotten humility, dialogue, and responsibility.

Will India, with its history of resilience and democracy, allow itself to slide into dictatorship? Or will the people once again rise to remind those in power that they serve, not rule, this nation?

india,month,What if our country used Jira?,"TL;DR:
I manage Jira at work and realized how it keeps every task visible, traceable, and on schedule. If our government used a similar system with SLAs, audits, and digital accountability, corruption and inefficiency could vanish. The tech exists. The will.. I really don’t know.

I recently got promoted and now manage Jira for my company. After seeing how smooth and accountable everything becomes when every single task is tracked, I had a crazy thought. If a company can run thousands of projects through Jira with clear responsibilities, deadlines, and visibility, why can’t our government do the same?

Every day I see how Jira keeps teams honest. There’s no “I forgot” or “it’s pending” excuse. Each issue has an assignee, a due date, a status, and a record of every action. If something isn’t done, everyone knows exactly where it got stuck. Now imagine this system applied to government offices, where every officer has digital tasks with strict SLAs to close them.

You could raise a ticket for a broken road or a delayed document, and it would automatically go to the responsible department. If they don’t fix it on time, it shows up in their performance report. Repeated delays could trigger review or even removal. An independent audit team could also conduct random anonymous checks to make sure no one’s manipulating data. The entire workflow would be traceable and fair.

The craziest part is that the technology already exists. India has Digital India, e-Office, and GatiShakti platforms. Expanding them into a single transparent task management system is totally doable. The real obstacle isn’t the tech.. it’s the system itself. Many people benefit from things staying vague. Bureaucratic power thrives on opacity. When everything is tracked, it removes the ability to delay for favors or bribes.

If this kind of structure were actually implemented, it could transform how governance works. Citizens would get faster service, officers would be rewarded for efficiency, and departments would finally be run on real data instead of excuses. We already have the infrastructure and talent. What’s missing is the intent to make every public office accountable.

If governments can adopt systems like this, nothing can stop us from becoming a fully developed nation.",124,52,2025-10-18,ShubhamPandeyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1o9rv15/what_if_our_country_used_jira/
india,month,Make my trip: Seat fraud! Beware,"Hi everyone, I had booked a flight ticket for my dad for a round trip from Kochi to Toronto. 

While booking, I had specifically booked aisle seat on the flights (its a 1 stop flight via Auh) as he preferred those seats. I had to pay an extra 5k+ for the seats. 

After couple of months, my mom wanted to return back to India in the same flight as my dad (earlier she was supposed to fly back at a different date due to other plans). 

My mom wanted seats next to my dad so I used make my trip again to book her ticket. Surprisingly, the seats I had earlier reserved for my dad was also available for booking. I checked his flight tickets and there it was showing seat numbers. I checked on the Etihad website also for confirmation and his seats were showing as available/not reserved.

I became concerned and after repeated chatting with the Bot (utterly useless), I connected over call to a Make my trip agent and explained the situation to him. He told me the seats were cancelled and refund was given. 

While on the call, I checked my email and bank account for the dates he mentioned for refund and I didn't receive a communication email or refund to my bank. 

I told him I haven't received anything (email or refund) and he continues to repeat that an email is sent from his side. I requested him to forward or resend that email and he said its not possible as it was automated. 

I asked him to show some proof of communication and he refused, claiming he cannot forward an automated email or take a screenshot/photo.

I asked about the money and he told it was refunded and he will share the ARA number which I can use to check with my bank. I asked him to send it to me and he said he cant send it but rather only dictate it over the call as he is not authorized to send via email or message. He was also not willing to escalate this issue to someone who had more authority. 

Pathetic customer service and seems like a scam at this point!! They have the time to send hundreds of messages and emails for promotions but complete apathy when it comes to customer care.

india,month,Extreme distaste for technology and automation investments by small and medium businesses. Why?,"I am based in US, have been for few years, but did work in India for years before moving.

Recently, a relative who owns a small business and a brand for cooking oil, pretty popular in Western region, reached out for a solution for automation in dispensing oil.

Their current method is regardless of temperature or density or viscosity, they pour oil on a scale and keep pouring until desired weight is reached. Takes too long, and causes work to flow over into overtime, despite having two 8/9 hour shifts.

So, they reach out to me for a solution. I give them a total system solution, automated oil dispensing, based on calibrated load cells, PLC programmed, automated electro-pneumatic valve, tank heating solution to keep oil warm so its always flowing - based on gas heating, since gas is available.

Total cost was about INR 35L. Would have moved them into a single shift, more productivity, tracked their batches with dispensing memory storage, and given multiple features, allowing their people to focus on stuff like shipping, packaging etc.

Provided with multiple stripped down versions as well. Lowest cost was about 20L.

Decided not to go ahead with it, ""too much investment needed"". Payback period was less than 2 years, considering savings from reduced shift, capacity expansions, despite the need for air compressor and a gas based hot water heater.

We do business with some small and medium sized businesses in India. There is a consistent distrust of investing in automation and newer technology. Even when the payback period or ROI exists, say above 11% per year, which is what major stock indices in India return year-on-year on average.

Why? Why is there such a hesitancy in investing in automation? Yes, I realize labor is very cheap, but even in cases, where return is evident, costs lower than even the cheap labor, small businesses or medium businesses don't want to invest in automation?

Another issue is technology. I have seen small businesses using Windows 7 or Windows 10, not getting Microsoft business suite of apps. One business we work with, refused to even get a shareable dashboard on PowerBI, and until our VP of US business threatened pulling back work, did they get Microsoft office apps, and even then a single account. Their whole data is still a mess.

The same small business refuses to install a scheduling application, and instead wants to do scheduling manually, frequently causing issues and lack of transparency, if our urgent priority orders have even been scheduled or planned.

Another business based in Bengaluru, which is supposed to be the tech capital, insists on using SolidEdge, a 3-D CAD program by siemens, instead of what our entire network uses - SolidWorks. With all our vendors using SolidWorks, we can leverage spare facility capacity across the world to make spare parts and problem is except for the Indian business, as sharing models and sub-assemblies across platforms is a horrendous, painstaking journey. What this results in, even if the Indian business has spare capacity, they won't get more work just because nobody wants to put in assemblies in SolidEdge from SolidWorks and go through ensuring that stuff doesn't get screwed up.

OTOH, Chinese. Vietnamese and Thai companies we work with, even small ones, are absolutely extremely happy to get onboard, at a request, not the threat of pulling back work. Why is there a massive difference in attitudes towards getting on-board with newer technology or automation in Indian businesses?

What can be done to encourage small and medium sized businesses to be welcoming instead of being so hesitant?",48,35,2025-10-18,Ok-Pea3414,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1oa4h9p/extreme_distaste_for_technology_and_automation/

What makes me sad is how people have forgotten what Diwali was. This day, Bhagwan Ram came back from the vanvaas. It is supposed to be the festival of lights, happiness, togetherness, and joy.  
I don't understand why people have made this festival only about bursting crackers. Sure, I was all for the idea of celebrating one's joy by bursting crackers. But India is already extremely polluted and even among the most polluted in the world. So why the fuck would people want to make this worse already, and that too in the name of religion? This is not what this wonderful festival is about.  
These are the same people who have no sense of responsibility and blame everything wrong on the government. The government is wrong in many many many things, but they are not the ones who are bursting crackers or burning stubble.

india,month,Child marriage is still a dark side of India. It's ruining lives and no one is talking about.,"Even in 2025, child marriage remains a disturbingly real issue in India, especially in rural and conservative communities. We often talk about education, women’s rights, mental health, or gender equality — but child marriage rarely enters mainstream discussions, despite its deep, lifelong impact on individuals and society.
Let’s talk about what really happens behind those “traditional” practices that are often justified as culture or family honor.

When a child is married off, they’re robbed of their autonomy, safety, and development. They don’t even fully understand what “marriage” means.
They grow up carrying guilt, confusion, and fear, often mistaking control or coercion for love.
Many experience chronic anxiety, depression, and low self-worth because they were never given a chance to make choices for themselves.
Girls often internalize silence and submission, while boys can develop distorted ideas of dominance, responsibility, and emotional detachment.

Child marriage cuts off education — especially for girls. A child who could have pursued learning, friendships, and career aspirations instead becomes trapped in domestic roles.
Interrupted schooling = lost confidence, lost identity, and dependency.
Early pregnancies are common, leading to serious health risks and even death.
Cognitive and emotional maturity stops evolving naturally because they’re forced to act like adults long before they are one.

Many who were child brides or grooms later realize they never had a say in choosing their life partner. This leads to:
Emotional disconnect and lack of intimacy.
Resentment, unhealed trauma, and often marital breakdowns.
Difficulty understanding what healthy love or consent means.
Repeated cycles — where parents who were married as children often push their own children into the same path, unconsciously repeating trauma.

As adults, survivors of child marriage often struggle with trust, communication, and social belonging.
They feel alienated, unable to relate to peers who lived freely in their youth.
Many hide their past due to shame or fear of judgment.
Family relations are strained because the “elders” who forced the marriage still control their choices — even decades later.
Generations grow up emotionally fractured, stuck between obedience and the desire for independence.

People normalize child marriage by calling it tradition, adjustment, or family decision. But the truth is — it’s a violation of a child’s right to grow, think, and choose. It’s psychological imprisonment disguised as culture.
If we truly care about empowerment and progress, we need to start talking about this openly — not just in NGOs and news headlines, but in our homes, classrooms, and online spaces.

india,month,how indian students learned to stop thinking and love the system,"sometimes i feel like people in this country have completely forgotten how to think for themselves. i was scrolling through reddit the other day, looking at posts on some study subs, and the kind of things kids defend just makes my blood boil. on one post, someone compared how chemistry is taught abroad, with actual experiments, curiosity, observation, and inquiry versus how we learn it here, scribbling endless reactions on a blackboard like mindless robots. instead of questioning the system, instead of asking why we have to memorize reactions instead of understanding mechanisms, kids were actually defending the system. they were saying things like “doing experiments for every reaction isn’t feasible” or “there are too many reactions to do in a lab.” like, did no one think to question why there are so many reactions to memorize in the first place? the whole point of chemistry is to observe and understand how substances behave, not turn it into a memory contest. the fact that no one questions why the board can’t reduce the number of reactions or reframe the syllabus around understanding rather than rote learning shows how deep this blind acceptance runs.

>the tragedy of our system is not that students fail to learn, but that they stop learning the moment they start succeeding. it doesn’t test what you know. it tests how well you can ignore what you don’t understand.

and this isn’t just about chemistry. this mindset bleeds into everything. look at how students defend the jee culture. they talk about how hard work is sacred, how studying 12 hours a day is noble, how pain builds character. and sure, discipline and effort are valuable. but what if the thing you’re working hard at isn’t even something you’re interested in? what if the very system you’re devoting your youth to is broken? it’s like glorifying suffering for the sake of suffering. i honestly think the people who say studying 12 hours a day for jee is “pure and beautiful” should also be forced to work 12 hour shifts at their jobs later in life just to see how that logic holds up. i see kids defending parents beating their children and calling it discipline or strict love, saying my parents hit me and i turned out fine. no, you didn’t turn out fine, you turned out emotionally numb and incapable of questioning authority.

>we’ve mistaken obedience for discipline, and silence for understanding. most people don’t defend the system because it’s good. they defend it because they survived it and can’t bear to think their suffering was pointless.

the thing that frustrates me is how kids can’t even see privilege when it’s right in front of them. i’m not saying everyone who clears jee doesn’t deserve credit. there are students from small towns who come up purely through grit, and i respect that deeply. but then there are kids from educated, well off families with access to good schools, guidance, and time, people who had a map while others were left out all by themselves. And they’ll have the audacity to still mock others for failing, acting like luck had nothing to do with their success. they’ll brag about their hard work while conveniently ignoring how their background gave them a head start. it’s like people are allergic to admitting that luck plays a role in life. veritasium made a great [video](https://youtu.be/3LopI4YeC4I?si=aypThcehBhlhvxEf) explaining this idea that success is partly effort and partly luck and yet no one wants to accept it. it’s as if acknowledging luck somehow threatens their ego.

>if hard work alone guaranteed success, every laborer would be a millionaire. yes, luck isn’t everything, but denying it is the easiest way to feel superior without actually being wise.

then there’s this obsession with competition over curiosity. kids today don’t have hobbies, don’t explore ideas, don’t try to come up with their own thoughts or theories. when you try to discuss something beyond exams, you get blank stares. no one wants to be a “jack of all trades,” to explore the world and develop a broad understanding before choosing what to master. instead, everyone wants to follow the same beaten path, chasing marks, coaching ranks, and college seats. people keep saying “increase the number of seats” in iits and nits, which is completely fair but why not also question why so many students want to cram themselves into the same handful of colleges? why don’t we encourage different paths, creative thinking, and alternative systems of learning? it’s like everyone’s locked into a single idea of success that was handed down to them before they were even old enough to question it.

>there’s a difference between learning and preparing for an exam and we’ve built an entire nation around the latter. kids today don’t fear failure, they fear thinking differently. you can’t build innovators out of people who’ve been punished for asking why.

and when someone dares to question it, they’re ridiculed. look at the apnacollege [readme.md](http://readme.md) case. . it’s like the idea of self reflection has become foreign. people no longer ask why, they just ask “how do i do it faster?” or “how do i do it better than the next person?” and that’s the saddest part. our education system has killed the very thing education is supposed to nurture i.e curiosity.

>curiosity is a flame our schools and society spend years trying to put out. in a country that worships marks, curiosity is considered rebellion. the system doesn’t reward intelligence but rather it rewards compliance disguised as effort.

maybe i sound bitter, but im just tired. im tired of seeing kids lose themselves to a system that measures intelligence by memorization, obedience, and exhaustion. im tired of how easily people justify what’s clearly broken just because it worked out for them. im tired of seeing children being told that their only worth lies in a rank or a report card. and what worries me most is that this mindset doesn’t stop at school. it follows them into adulthood. the same people who defended this system as students grow up to become adults who defend every broken institution, because they never learned how to question one in the first place.

>the saddest part of our system is that the ones who learn to question it are too exhausted to change it. education in india isn’t about understanding the world. it’s about surviving the system that explains it. every generation that refuses to question passes its silence down as tradition.

life isn’t a meritocracy. it’s a mix of effort, environment, and luck. and unless we start acknowledging that, unless we start encouraging kids to think, question, and explore instead of just compete, we will keep producing generations that can solve equations but can’t solve problems. we’ll keep producing people who can memorize facts but can’t think. and honestly, that’s the biggest tragedy of all.

>there’s a reason why we produce toppers instead of thinkers. toppers maintain the system. thinkers rebuild it. most students never get to ask who they are, because the system already decided what they must become. when questioning authority is seen as arrogance, mediocrity becomes the new excellence. we live in a world where memorization is celebrated and imagination is treated as a distraction.

uniqueness is dying, and with it, the soul of our generation. every street, every college, every coaching center looks like a reflection of the same dream sold a thousand times over. everywhere you go, people are chasing the same degrees, the same exams, the same jobs, the same idea of success that was handed to them by someone else. it’s as if the system has erased individuality and replaced it with a blueprint. follow this path, achieve this number, and call it purpose. people who think differently, who want to explore art, philosophy, literature, or history, are mocked or silenced because they don’t fit into the assembly line. kids who dare to study humanities are treated as if they’ve already failed at life. adults who quit stable jobs to follow something meaningful are ridiculed for being unrealistic. this not just fucking cultural conditioning, it’s mass conformity disguised as an ambition.

this uniformity is slowly destroying the foundation of innovation and creativity. a society cannot progress if everyone is thinking the same way, chasing the same reward, or fearing the same failure. the job market will soon overflow with degrees but run dry of ideas. research will stagnate because curiosity has been replaced with competition. our economy will produce workers, not thinkers. efficiency, not imagination. and politically, a generation that has never questioned authority or convention will only follow louder voices, never the truer ones. history will fade because no one wants to read it. literature will weaken because no one wants to write it. the arts will disappear because no one wants to feel anymore. this problem isn’t confined to india, it’s spreading across the world, where education has become a marketplace and learning has become a transaction. and if this continues, the future won’t just be uniform, it’ll be empty. a world filled with people who never really lived their own lives, only performed the version that was expected of them.

>it very much feels like sitting alone with a song you’ve heard a thousand times, but for the first time, you finally listen. the melody hasn’t changed, the world hasn’t changed, but something inside you does. and in that moment, you stop following the rhythm you were given, and start asking why it was ever playing in the first place.",46,21,2025-10-14,Ok_Professional2491,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1o6caot/how_indian_students_learned_to_stop_thinking_and/
india,month,Looking for reformatory institutions / military schools in India for a severely misbehaving teen,"Hey everyone,
We’re looking for guidance on institutions in India that can help rehabilitate a highly difficult teenager — ideally structured environments like reformatory homes, military boarding schools, or similar setups.

My 14-year-old brother-in-law has been formally diagnosed with ADHD + Oppositional Defiant Disorder. He is adopted and lives with elderly parents who are finding it impossible to manage him.

There’s a history of repeated aggressive/defiant behavior — getting into trouble, stealing money at home, and mixing with the wrong crowd. We’re worried he’s headed toward more serious issues, and we want to intervene before things go bad.

We’re desperately looking for:
1) Military-discipline schools ( or ) 
2) Reformatory/behavioral intervention institutions. ( or )
3) Rehabilitation-focused boarding setups
4) Any NGOs / govt programs that work with such teens

Location is flexible. If you have any leads, personal experiences, or contacts, please comment or DM.
We’re trying to make sure he gets the right structure and support before things escalate.

Thank you 🙏",0,21,2025-11-02,lotofthought,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ommbl1/looking_for_reformatory_institutions_military/
india,month,tired of complaining how broken our cities are,"every day i scroll through the news and it’s the same thing. accidents, rapes, murders, broken roads, garbage, people living in horrible conditions. it’s like there’s no end to how bad things can get here. it honestly messes with my head sometimes.

the stress of daily life is constant. pollution, dust, noise, traffic, unplanned construction. nothing feels easy. i feel powerless most days.

i did my undergrad in sydney and that was the first time i saw how a city can actually work. you don’t need a car. public transport just works. there are parks, plazas, beaches, markets that are clean and safe. people follow rules. public spaces are respected. it all felt so natural.

but still, i came back. because sydney never felt like home. i missed the food, the people, the chaos, the culture. i missed that sense of belonging. but when i came back, reality hit hard.

the roads, the trash, the corruption, the disregard for rules, it all just gets to you. i kept ranting about it to anyone who’d listen. and every single time, i’d get the same line.

“Yeh India hai, yaha sab chalta hai”

and maybe they’re right. anyone can complain. but if you really care, you should do something. that line has been stuck in my head for a while.

i’ve been lucky. i don’t have to worry about money before making most decisions. i know that’s a privilege. and i think i owe it to myself to use it for something that matters.

i love jaipur. i love its history, the architecture, the food, the energy. but i want it to be more. i want it to be a city people are proud of. clean air, proper drainage, working public transport, walkable roads, functioning infrastructure. basic things that shouldn’t feel like a luxury.

for years i’ve been voting but never for someone i actually look up to. always the least worst option. i’m tired of waiting for a young leader to show up and speak our language. so i’ve decided to at least try to be that voice myself.

i’m an introvert and i know this will take time. i’m thinking of starting small, probably here on reddit, maybe later on youtube or wherever people my age actually listen. just starting conversations about the issues that matter and what we can actually do.

if things go well, my long term goal is to run for mla from malviya nagar in 2028. i don’t know if it’ll work out, maybe it won’t. but i’d rather try than spend my whole life regretting that i never did anything.

i’ll stay anonymous for now. even my family laughs at the idea of me doing something like this. but hopefully over time i’ll grow a thicker skin.

i just needed to write this somewhere. it’s been sitting heavy on me for almost a year now. i feel a bit lighter after typing it all out.

if you’ve read till here, thank you. i’m sure some of you feel the same way. tired, frustrated, angry, but still in love with this place. i don’t know if we can change everything, but maybe we can start somewhere.",20,17,2025-11-03,Pitiful_Bluebird4843,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ongrmg/tired_of_complaining_how_broken_our_cities_are/
india,month,Moving to India from the US with a clinical psych PhD?,"Currently in a long distance relationship with me in the US and partner in India. My partner’s job is highly localized, so I have more flexibility to move. I’m currently doing a PhD in clinical psych in a top 10-20 university in the US, and want to get a sense of success if I move back to India (I’ve grown up here when younger). I’ve already won national recognition for my work, and don’t have any doubt of my success in the US. 

Will I be able to succeed financially in Mumbai with my degree? What is the licensing process?  I’m assuming there’s no real scope to continue the research I’m interested in, giving politics and lack of general funding. Any advice would be helpful. 

I know that it makes more sense to continue to stay in the US, but I also want to give my long term relationship a chance if there is one. This is a very emotionally difficult situation overall, so please be kind and let me know what all I can do. 

I’m very good at psych research, stats, clinical work (just starting though) etc. so I’m not concerned about skills. I won’t be able to give therapy in Hindi/Marathi or anything, I’m not as fluent there professionally fully but perfectly good mixing languages in with English.

india,month,"While we choke on smog every winter, greenhouse gases aren't even legally classified as ""pollutants"" in India","Another year, another smog season, Delhi's AQI crosses 400, no one can go outside, and life goes on. Delhi govt will start its rant about farmers in Punjab/Haryana who will blame it on cars and thermal plants till someone smart comes and put it all on Pakistan and next year we play the same game.

I was going through research on environment law in India and read this fantastic paper that shows why things will not be improving in India anytime soon. 

To start with, irrespective of what govt says, about its work on cleaner air, Greenhouse gases are legally NOT classified as pollutants in India. The National Green Tribunal explicitly ruled that greenhouse gases like HFC-23 are ""not a pollutant or a toxic gas which is harmful to human health."" They're just greenhouse gases, which apparently is different.

This matters because the Environment Protection Act 1986 and all our air quality laws only regulate ""pollutants."" This means you literally cannot challenge a coal plant or any major project under environmental law based on its greenhouse gas emissions.  So while we're gasping for air every November, the legal system doesn't even recognize the gases causing long term climate change (which makes smog worse) as something that needs regulating. Farmer burning stubble are also not immune from damage they cause, the unseasonal rain this time around harvest season has ruined a lot of crop. 

And, this is just the tip of the iceberg, between 2018 and 2023, the central government made over 100 changes to environmental clearance rules. Not through Parliament, just notifications, allowing them to rewrite the entire framework whenever they want. One change lets them declare any project ""strategic to national security"" and exempt it from public hearings or disclosure. Another lets illegal projects get retroactive approval, plain corruption 101.

A University of Surrey study just analyzed how Indian climate law actually works and found that the entire legal framework is designed to NOT hold anyone accountable for emissions. Environmental law doesn't cover climate and climate commitments under Paris Agreement aren't legally binding here because Parliament never ratified it through legislation.

The big picture environmental and climate framework is that it's designed to look like we're doing something while ensuring nobody can actually be held liable.

Every winter we blame farmers burning stubble, we do odd even, halt construction, buy air purifiers, and tell people to stay indoors. But the legal system is structured so that the biggest emitters face zero consequences.

And we wonder why air quality is a crisis every single year.

If you are concerned about the envrionemnt, do give this paper a fantastic read, and start raising the right questions, the govt responds when we pressure them, the GST relief came once people started making noise on social media, this too can work, but we need to be focusing on the right questions and not get lost in the blame game.

india,month,I am an alien in my own country. And so are my parents.,"What I am about to share here is something I have kept close to my chest until now. Because, unfortunately, I have tried to deal with this on my own, but I have realized I am no longer capable of doing so. I have also realized that my family and I have been facing this issue for far too long and keeping silent about it isn't doing us much favor.

For all intents and purposes, I will be keeping my identity and my parents identity a secret. However, this is a story that my parents and I have experienced for quite some time.

  
I was born in Hyderabad. Based on what my parents mentioned later in my life, conceiving me was a decision they took after coaxing from their parents. The relation between my parents and my grandparents wasn't great. 

My grandfather favored other relatives over his own children and this caused a lot of friction between my parents and my grandparents. Eventually, when my father realized he was being manipulated and coaxed into joining a business by his parents, he and my mom distanced ourselves from them.

So, for me, the only people I could depend on were my parents. Because I was an introvert by nature, I couldn't foster any friendships when i was in school. Even the few i had was due to group projects and homeworks. 



So, with what little resources they had, they still manage to give me the education needed to get a decent job. I graduated from Regency Institute of Technology, Yanam in 2018, when it was still open. Got a Bachelors degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. This institute was affiliated to Pondicherry University, so when the institute was closed down, my degree remained valid. 

However, keep in mind that for all this time, my parents could only afford the bare minimum and had to rely on what they had earned in their prime. So, this meant that for almost 15 years, we ended up living in Urban villages like Ghitorni, Yanam, Shaheen Bagh (when I got a KPO job in Noida), and so on. Not to mention that we couldn't afford buying any high end equipment or house during this period.

  
In 2019, I felt like things were finally going to be better when I got selected in an off-campus drive conducted by Infosys. We even opted for going to Mangalore so that our expenses would stay low. 

  
Nothing really changed. On the contrary, it got worse.

  
Since my parents were unable to earn anything and their health condition was getting worse, I had to handle all the expenses since 2019. This meant I had to take loans and credit ever since I got my first salary. What made things worse was the pandemic where we were forced to stay in a poorly maintained 1 BHK in Kaikamba for 2 years. While dad's life insurance policy matured in 2022, it only gave us a temporary respite as he only got enough to last us for a year. 

  
I have since worked in 3 projects as a Systems Administrator managing Linux servers and cloud environments for other clients of Infosys. However, the problems still remained the same on personal side of things.

  
My parent's mental health condition had also started to deteriorate as they couldn't find anyone who can understand their situation and offer a helping hand. On the contrary, everyone around us acted like we were some rich people ready to be taken advantage of. Anytime my dad said, ""My son works in Infosys as such and such...."" the immediate response was ""Oh! So you must be earning a lakh per month at least."" or ""You must be doing quite well then.""

My starting salary when I joined as a fresher was around Rs. 20k which only doubled recently, i.e., after 6 years. I couldn't shift to any other company because I was already taking  advances and loans continuously to make ends meet. Not to mention my parents medical needs. 

What also infuriates me is that we have shifted to multiple states, hoping that somewhere we could get a better quality of life. Despite my increase in salary and despite paying for a 1 bhk in a gated society, the water quality remained horrible. We constantly have to rely on buying Bisleri, the ONLY bottled water company in India that sells 10L and 20L water can.

I say ONLY because any other local water company has had a worse water quality compared to Bisleri. Even Bisleri cans differed between states. 

We couldn't afford raising a legal case or a court case against this as we just didn't have enough time or money to spend fighting this battle. Plus, my father and I are already aware of how futile our justice system truly is and how little it really cares about it. If you don't have enough money to pay for a trustworthy lawyer, you will only end up paying more than what it's worth. 

Ajnara Le Garden, one of the societies we have lived in, has a severe case of improper maintainence. This was back in 2023. Due to the leakage of pipes and construction taking right next to our society, it was far from an ideal place to live in. Yet, I have seen so many people just live their lives not knowing what they are actually suffering through.

  
We have taken countless measures of keeping ourselves safe. Water filters, disinfectants, mosquito nets, you name it. To even avoid dealing with delivery associates who didn't follow the normal behaviour of hitting the bell once, I had to go out of my way to coordinate with him and pick the package from the lobby. JUST to avoid conflict. 

  
Yet, none of these measures made any of our lives better. We have been trying to leave this country since the past few years. In that process, my parents have sold off the furniture and even discarded any belongings they had. Whatever jewelry we had was sold off long ago. 

Despite these sacrifices, I have been unable to help them move away from here. And unfortunately, I have tried asking for help but when everyone else around you are going through similar or worse situations, what can you do? I have also tried getting a freelance gig outside my area of expertise, i.e., by working on video editing jobs but all i could come across were fradulent job postings asking you to pay money just to get the job.

The most common suggestion that was given to me was ""Talk to you HR!"". As someone wise once said, the HR only cares about the welfare of the company, not you! They would only be responsible if your welfare affects theirs directly. Even then, I have tried. That resulted in me apologizing for asking assistance.

  
Of course, when I try to ask someone else outside of my workplace, they think I am trying to scam them and begin to distance themselves away from me. 

The whole point of being in a country and having a community is that we share our burden. Our issues. If we no longer do that, then what are we? My father used to share tales of his great grandfather having a great life with just a few Anna's. Nowadays, you cannot manage a week without Rs. 10000. Rs. 5000 if you're living in the suburbs.

  
I want to keep fighting and trying to get my parents to a better place where they can live the rest of their lives peacefully without facing the hassles they are going through now. I am prepared to sacrifice my life should that opportunity arise. But that is unfortunately not the case.  I have, indeed, become an alien in my own country because the people around me have turned a blind eye against what we face in our daily lives. And despite everything, I cannot find the opportunities that would help me escape this abyss. At least, that's how I feel. I'd like to know if any of you have gone through what I or my parents have gone through. It would also be helpful if you could tell me how you got out of your own abyss.",13,16,2025-10-31,Financial_Money3540,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1okqd3r/i_am_an_alien_in_my_own_country_and_so_are_my/
india,month,"SpiceJet offloads all passengers’ baggage from Patna–Hyderabad flight SG875, again. Airline admits delay of two more days.","I don’t usually post here, but this one deserves attention.
I was on SpiceJet flight SG875 from Patna to Hyderabad on 29 Oct, and the airline offloaded everyone’s baggage at Patna airport without informing a single passenger.
To make it worse, they had sent automated check-in messages confirming that baggage was loaded. Everyone trusted that notification, only to find at Hyderabad airport that not one bag had arrived.

Passengers panicked many had connecting flights, some had medicines, essentials, or work equipment in their luggage. Airline staff at Hyderabad had no clue, no announcement, no apology.

When I called their team, they casually said, Your baggage will be delayed by two more days.Initially, we were told the bags would be sent and delivered by 30th October evening. Now they’ve just pushed it further without any explanation.This isn’t even the first time the same flight did this yesterday too. It’s clearly not an accident; they knew what they were doing.
Honestly, I booked SpiceJet because I had no option left I know how they’re barely holding on, working in collaboration with Czech Airlines and already deep in losses. But this is beyond poor management. It’s outright irresponsible and unethical.

india,month,Figuring out India in baby steps,"Married to an Indian (Northern) for years, Im still struggling to explain some mysteries of the Indian life/culture that my husband failed to give an answer that makes sense:

1. why are cooking tools (knives and chopping board and peelers, scissors) are either not working, dirty and rusty with sticky substances- probably food residues, or extremely unproductive in the households' kitchen? The saucepan's lid has no handle/knob or the lid itself does not exist and some random plates would be used and require our hands to be exposed to direct boiling steams and risks of burning. It's unsafe, inconvenient, and unproductive - but why hasnt this changed? Why would the women accept spending more time in the kitchen due to poor tools that takes minutes to fix/changed so they can save time to rest or do their favorite things? Is it a reflection of the women's lower status in the (particular) society compared to their men counterpart?

2. Are most of the kitchens lacking microwave? Is it because of the metal plates and dinnerwares' propularity? Why are they even popular while they're so hot to touch while having the hot food, and of no beauty? Why are the upper kitchen cabinets usually partally/completely missing from the Indian kitchens I've visited while the home clearly needs more storage for the random kitchen-related things here and there?


3. Would you consider your hometown/society's general household hygiene standards lower than what you prefer/what you think it could and should be and why hasnt it been changed to meet what you prefer? As in hygiene, I meant the lack of toilet paper, almost non-existence of paper napkins, surfaces/counter/cabinet in the kitchen with oil residues, clothes always in eye-popping dye colors that fade to other people's clothes too, the careless dripping when pouring or distributing food/ not closing bottles and boxes tightly so food goes bad quickly, the lack of processing of ingredients before cooking like NOT taking our rotten/unusable leaves of herbs or peeling of some root veggie or pumpkin, the dark nail corners of people of older generations which definitely also comes in the food they eat by hand, colanders are not popular so no deep-water washing and the washing under the running tap doesnt remove all dirts, etc... 

4. What does it take to move a household's lifestyles towards more civilization/ convenience/ productivity, besides money - in your opinion or experiences? Have you ever seen a drastic upgrade in lifestyles (hygiene and the way people cook/eat) and what conditions enabled that?
We've doubled my in-law's income and these have not improved so I guess there are other underlying obstacles I need to solve first.

For context, we (since being together) has not lived in India, only East Asia and North America. My husband left India 10 years ago and is not good at articulating thoughts/ cultural analysis or observation - or he might be just insecured about admitting some ugly facts. During his childhood, his family also moved from place to place due to his father being a ""para-military"" officer so he has no ""deep root"" to a place/society like others.

I've never lived in India, only visiting and for a total of 45 days of all the trips to India in my life. Im concerned about these things because I want to understand/interpret them in a way that bridges my culture (where these things are considered bizzare and undesirable/unacceptable) and the Indian values that those things represent, so that I can teach my kids to accept/ appreciate both cultures which are sometimes conflicting. 

Please excuse my curiosity/ approach from another culture that differs so much from yours. I sincerely thank you for your patience and help to explain any of these isses to me!",0,15,2025-11-01,Which-Dragonfruit388,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1om0408/figuring_out_india_in_baby_steps/
india,month,How people decide their cultural identity?,"So, my mom is Bihari and my dad is Kashmiri. I always thought I was half Bihari and half Kashmiri and for the longest time, l felt like I didn't fully related to either of the cultures because they're so vastly different.
Then I saw this reel on Instagram where this woman was talking about her experience of being half Italian and half German. And she used to always say that this made her feel like she didn't fit in with either of the cultures. But when she started saying, I am Italian and German, which made her feel like she's both rather than half of each and she said people who don't make you feel welcome and part of the culture are actually gatekeeping assholes. And it doesn't matter if only one of your parents is from that culture, you can still feel whole in that culture without having to feel like you only belong in half of it or you only look like half the part, and that really healed something in me and made me feel more confident about my mixed identity.


But also, there's this other thing where a lot of people in India have migrated for jobs and stuff and they move their families from one state to the other. So both of your parents can be from Rajasthan, but you grew up in Mumbai or both of your parents can be Kannadigas, but you grew up in Tamil Nadu.
But then where do you say you are from?
Most people l've noticed say they are from the state in which they grew up and the language of that state which they speak is how they identify as, not necessarily by the culture/state of their parents. So this friend of mine, her parents are Pahadis, but she's born and brought up in Delhi. So she thinks of herself as a Punjabi because she grew up in a Punjabi neighborhood. I have this friend who's Kannadiga, but his parents moved to Tamil Nadu, so that's where he's born and brought up. So he speaks Tamil, but then I think at home he also speaks a little bit of Kannada. But then for the longest time I thought he's Tamil. It was only till today I found out that his parents are kannadiga! So basically I do want to understand how people associate the culture, where they're from. Is it like where their parents are from or where they were born and brought up?
And what about the kids whose parents are from two different states?


Or do people resonate with the culture of the parent that you're closer to? I'm more close to my mom and I'm more close to her family too. So I do personally think of myself more as Bihari in terms of my personality.
But since I was, of course, born and brought up in Kashmir, I have experienced Kashmiri culture more firsthand. So, not that l ever fit in. Kashmir is kind of very different! For that matter I don't even feel like a relate to all the things about Bihari culture as well! But there are a lot of things that I love about both the cultures. I love Bihari food. I love how sweet Bihari people are. The tone of speaking is very sweet and nice and rounded. I feel like a lot of other languages have very sharp tones. Bihari doesn't. Maybe because it's my mom's side of the family, so I think it's all sweet and round. My mom is very sweet and round. I love how beautiful Kashmir is, how everything looks like paradise. The houses are so pretty. It's all covered in wood and slopes and snow. I do like Kashmiri food too.
Not every day, but once in a while, yes. I love Noon Chai. I love going for walks. I love sitting by Dal Lake. So many core memories of my childhood are tied to that place. But still I can never get myself to say that I'm from Kashmir without feeling like l'm lying or cheating. I can never say that I'm from Bihar because l've never lived there. Even when I did go to Bihar, I was made to feel like l'm an outsider and I don't really fit in. Obviously, it's all coming from my own experience. I just want to know it there are any other people who have been in a similar situation, the same boat and what their experience was like and how do they feel about this?",9,11,2025-10-15,the_beelover,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1o7am83/how_people_decide_their_cultural_identity/
india,month,The “Masterstroke” Syndrome,"Every time something chaotic happens in this country... some “bold move” out of nowhere... you can already predict the IT cell playbook. Within hours, you’ll see the same words floating all over Twitter, WhatsApp, and god knows where else: *“Masterstroke,” “Bold decision,” “Historic move.”*

It’s like they’ve automated praise. Doesn’t even matter what the move *is.* One fine day, you wake up and the 500 and 1000 rupee notes are just fancy wallpaper now? “Masterstroke.”  
Nation goes into lockdown overnight, millions stranded without food or transport? “Masterstroke.”  
Article 370 revoked without proper planning? “Bold move.”  
Gas prices through the roof? “Sacrifice for the nation.”  
Next week if the sky falls, someone will tweet “Don’t worry guys, it’s part of a 4D chess plan.”

What’s crazy is how they’ve managed to turn rashness into a kind of national aesthetic. It’s like if it’s sudden, disruptive, and hurts a lot of people, it *must* be visionary. The more panic it causes, the more “strategic” it apparently is.We’ve reached a point where thoughtfulness is seen as weakness, and chaos looks like leadership. People genuinely equate good governance with shock value now. “At least he did something,” they say... as if doing *anything* is automatically better than thinking before doing.

Meanwhile, every actual economist, policy expert, and half-decent bureaucrat is sitting there like bro, maybe think before you nuke the currency? But no, that’s “anti-national.”And the IT cell is like that friend who always justifies their bad decisions. “Yeah, I crashed the car... but it was to test the airbags.”

It’s wild how every failure gets rebranded as “pain for long-term gain.” Like there’s always some invisible 10D plan that only true patriots can understand. Where is that gain though? Demonitisation wrecked small businesses, the lockdown destroyed migrant livelihoods, inflation’s a mess... and yet we’re still told “you just don’t get it.” Maybe that’s the trick: make failure look like foresight, and people stop asking questions.

But here’s the truth... leadership isn’t about looking decisive. It’s about *being* responsible. Consultation, planning, data; these aren’t boring bureaucratic things. They’re literally what separate governance from gambling.

India doesn’t need another surprise announcement at 8 p.m. It needs boring, careful, evidence-based decision-making. The kind that doesn’t need hashtags to justify itself.

Because this “Masterstroke” obsession... it’s not patriotism. It’s political gaslighting with better branding.",22,6,2025-10-27,Artistic_Virus_3443,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ohqgg0/the_masterstroke_syndrome/

I’m a 2023 CSE graduate. Been unemployed for almost 2 years, and recently joined a draftsman job in the UAE . I’m making 3000 AED (≈₹75k), but honestly, I hate this job — it has nothing to do with what I studied.

I’ve decided to quit and go back to India to restart my career in IT. My goal is to land at least a ₹6 LPA (~₹50k/month) job, but I’m literally starting from zero again.

I’d really appreciate advice from people who’ve been through this:

Which tech stack or field should I start with (something beginner-friendly but in demand)?

Any online courses / YouTube channels that actually helped you land a job?

How to build projects or a portfolio that impress recruiters?

How long does it realistically take to get job-ready (in months)?

Basically  if you were me in 2025, how would you start over and get into IT?",2,9,2025-10-20,FixMaster7070,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1oblldn/2023_cse_grad_unemployed_for_2_years_stuck_in_uae/
india,month,Struggling to get the Job?,"Hi everyone,
My girlfriend worked in an MNC for around 1 year in the mainframe domain in Bengaluru. In 2023, she had to resign because of serious health issues. At that time, her health mattered more than anything, and I was the one who encouraged her to step back and recover fully which regretting myself.

Thankfully, she’s much better now and ready to get back to work. But over the last year, she’s been trying really hard to restart her career  applying everywhere, attending interviews, reaching out to recruiters, and even trying through both her and my network. Despite all this effort, she’s not been able to find a single genuine opportunity.

The issue everyone keeps pointing out is her career gap. It’s disheartening because she’s technically skilled, motivated, and willing to start even from the bottom again. She’s not being picky at all  she’s open to any IT-related role now, not just mainframe (testing, support, backend, QA, data, anything). She just wants a fair chance to prove herself again.

But it’s been frustrating because most companies either ghost her or reject her immediately after noticing the break. To make it worse, several people we spoke to have suggested the so-called “backdoor” route basically paying someone or faking experience to get a job. Some even claim that’s the “only realistic way” now.

We’re absolutely not okay with that. We don’t want to go through dishonest or fake means  it might give short-term results, but it’s not right, and it can backfire later. We just want to do this honestly.

So, Is backdoor the only option left after a gap?
Or are there genuine, proven ways for someone with around 1 year of MNC experience to restart an IT career honestly, even after a break?

If you’ve been through something like this or helped someone who was, please share what actually worked.

Here’s what we’ve already tried:
Job portals (Naukri, LinkedIn, etc.) updated resume, applied daily.
Contacted recruiters and hiring managers on LinkedIn.
Attended a few interviews, but most didn’t progress because of the “gap.”
Tried networking through friends and ex-colleagues  no luck so far.


She’s open to reskilling or
Returnship or comeback programs, if any actually exist and hire

We’ve seen a few “women comeback” or “career restart” programs online, but many look inactive or are only for people with more years of experience. If anyone knows companies that genuinely run active returnship programs in India (IT domain), please drop some names or links.

We’d also love tips on how to present the gap positively on her resume  maybe something like mentioning it was a health recovery period, or listing learning/training done during that time.

I know there are many people out there who’ve faced breaks for health, family, or personal reasons  and it’s really tough to get a fair second chance in IT. We’re not expecting miracles, just some honest direction from people who’ve seen this before.

So please  if you’ve restarted your career or helped someone do it, what actually helped? Any path, certification, training or approach that really works?

We’re tired of hearing “backdoor” as the only solution. There has to be a genuine way for sincere, skilled people to get back into her career.

Any real advice, ideas, or encouragement would mean a lot right now.

india,month,"Fertility fraud is bailable in India despite 8 to 12 year sentences, and victims cannot file complaints directly. Current Law needs changes","I was reading a recent legal study comparing our fertility fraud laws with the US and something is seriously wrong with how we have designed the ART Act 2021. The law as it stands says if someone commits fertility fraud like using wrong sperm/eggs without consent or exploiting donors, they can get 8 to 12 years in prison but then the same law makes these offenses bailable which means that court cannot deny bail, it is a matter of right to get bail. Even worse is that victims cannot go to a police station and file an FIR directly, only the National or State Board can file complaints on their behalf, which adds unnecessary bureaucratic nightmare in between for no reason. 

Think about what this means in practice, a woman discovers her fertility doctor used his own sperm instead of the donor she chose, or a donor discovers their eggs were used in ways they never agreed to, they cannot take direct legal action. They have to petition a government board and hope the board decides their case is worth pursuing.

The study points out we had the world's second IVF baby in 1978 and we only passed this Act in 2021. That is 43 years of basically zero regulation while fertility clinics mushroomed across the country because we became a medical tourism destination for cheap IVF.

And when we finally pass a law, we make it toothless by requiring government intermediaries for victims to even file complaints. The paper documents an actual case from Tamil Nadu where a minor girl was forced by her stepfather to undergo egg extraction procedures multiple times. If you do not know, this means weeks of hormone injections and then surgical extraction from ovaries. 

He was convicted for sexual assault but NOT for forcing her through the reproductive procedures as the law did not recognize that as a separate violation. Compare this to the US where 9 states now have fertility fraud laws. In those states, victims can file directly, in Texas and Iowa, it is classified as a sexual offense and some states like Kentucky allow even the children born from fraud to file their own cases for damages.

Irony is the ART Act calls these serious crimes worthy of 8 to 12 years but then treats them like regulatory violations where you need permission from a board to even file a complaint. Either we think this is a serious crime involving bodily autonomy and reproductive rights, or we think it is an administrative issue, we cannot have it both ways.

The researchers argue that using someone's reproductive material without consent should be treated similarly to Section 376C IPC which deals with sexual offenses by people in authority because there is a doctor patient power dynamic and it involves violation of bodily autonomy but our current law uses vague language like ""exploitation"" which sounds more like financial fraud than violation of reproductive rights.

The study also points out that we do not even give legal standing to the children born from such fraud and only patients can be victims under our law. Not donors whose material was misused. Not children who discover decades later their biological father was actually their mother's doctor.

I know there are bigger issues in India but this seems like such an obviously flawed law. Why make something punishable by 12 years but also bailable? Why require government boards to file complaints instead of letting victims file directly? Not sure if I am missing something but this law needs a serious overhaul.

For the sake of discussion can we ignore negatives and channel all our discussions on what we should solve for?

I worked in tech for 15 years and having gone through lots of job loss waves made me think why we solve our own problems than be beggars for job outside. Having lived abroad for years also make me think migration is not the solution for problems. 

I am from Punjab and there are few funamental challenges that I think tech can solve

\- Farming and customers are still not connected directly, I see local farmers try to sell on own they are successful, but largely the connection is missing.

\- Aimless degree selling business in higher education with no link to practical problems, how to build a culture where students become enterpreuners than job seekers

\- Having got taste of sharemarket and trading, I think we can learn a lot from Gujrat. Everyone from that state participates in share market and generates wealth for themselves. We in Punjab do not use tech to do that

\- Use of rain water harvesting and ponds to recharge water problems of Punjab. Most of my state has almost no drinking water left or whatever is left is containing heavy metals.

\- Is there any tech that can help with controlling floods? We got lot of damage recently, can concrete walls help in that case?

I’m asking everyone for advice on my future. I’m completely lost and don’t know what to do. I know many people might scroll past this, but if even one person takes a little time to read and reply, I’ll be forever grateful. 🙏

My Background: Poverty and Fear
My name is Suman, I’m 21, and I come from a poor family. To be honest, I’m not much of a genius, and money is nonexistent. My family includes my elder sister, my parents, and me.

My father used to be a cook in the Coal India Limited canteen, but he lost his job during Covid. My mother works in other people’s houses, washing dishes and cleaning floors. My father now works as a cook in one household. My sister finished her graduation and is desperately job-hunting but hasn’t found anything yet. That’s enough about my family — now about me.

I don’t have many options — no money, no strong educational background. On top of that, I’m an extreme introvert. This combination made school hell for me. I went through terrible ragging and humiliation — even physical — but I never spoke up. I was too scared. Because of this fear, I often skipped school and grew up with almost no friends. The one friend I did make… changed later and left me behind.


---

Life Stops with Covid
I finished my 10th (Madhyamik) in 2018 and was already worried about my future because I was an Arts student. I was scared of math, and honestly, I still am. Then Covid hit, and it felt like my life completely stopped. My father lost his job, and our financial situation got much worse.

In 2020, I met a friend — my sister’s boyfriend’s cousin. We became close while learning to ride bicycles together. Slowly, he became my best friend. We did everything together. I even got a small restaurant job near my house, saved money, and bought my first phone — something my parents couldn’t afford for me. That was my first small achievement. But I had to quit the job before Durga Puja because the owner made me work extra hours without pay.

We started spending time with some local guys, playing PUBG and wasting time. We had fights, made up, and repeated the cycle. The days just passed by like that.

Then I got an auto-pass in my 12th exam because of Covid. My friend was a class below me, so he gave his exam a bit later.


---

The Turning Point and the Dream
After some fights and distance, my friend and I patched up again. One day, he suddenly told me that he wanted to change his life — that he didn’t want to waste time anymore. His words motivated me too. For the first time in my life, I started dreaming big.

We decided we’d both do something meaningful, something that could change our lives. We even planned to leave college so we could work, save money, and buy laptops to learn new skills. Eventually, we both did — he helped me get a job, and after months of saving, I finally bought a laptop. It was a huge moment for me.

I even planned a small trip to Darjeeling for his birthday, along with another friend I met at work. It was the first trip of my life — my first time seeing mountains. I paid for my best friend’s expenses because he meant that much to me.

But even before the trip, I had started noticing small changes in him. He became distant, secretive, and uninterested in our plans. After Darjeeling, he changed completely. He stopped talking to me, ignored calls, and began insulting me whenever I tried to fix things. I cried many times. Eventually, we had a huge fight and broke off contact. It’s been months now, and I still can’t move on.

I keep dreaming about him, thinking about how he’s moving forward in life while I’m stuck, broken, and lost.

My Confusion and Despair About the Future
I had planned — and still hope — to go into programming. I started learning Python, Linux, and English at home. Some people told me it’s possible for Arts students to enter this field, but it’s very hard.

Then someone said I should first learn “Computer Science fundamentals” and “basic computer knowledge.” That completely broke me. I felt like I’m standing in the middle of an endless ocean with just a drop of knowledge — drowning slowly.

Now, I’m mentally exhausted. I’m scared, confused, and totally demotivated. My family doesn’t support what I’m doing. They think I’m wasting time. They often say things like, “You shouldn’t dream of earning lakhs while lying on a torn blanket.”

But I don’t want to live a small life. I don’t want to work like a machine — work, eat, sleep, repeat — and die without ever fulfilling my dreams. I want to give my parents a better life, to see them happy and proud.

Right now, I don’t have any other options. I’m just asking… should I continue learning programming? Is it really possible for someone like me — an Arts student, no Computer Science background, no money, no talent — to build a future in this field?

I’m scared of failing, but I don’t want to give up. I just don’t know how to continue. My mental state is getting worse, and I can’t focus. The only friend who used to motivate me is gone. I think about him every single day. It hurts, it burns, and it’s breaking me from the inside.

Sometimes I even feel like giving up completely. I wonder — can poor people ever achieve anything big? Is there any hope left for people like me?

Please… if anyone’s reading this, I’m begging for a little guidance. Please tell me what I should do. My days are just passing by, and I feel like I’m disappearing.

I’m reposting this because I really, really need help. Please try to reply to me if you can.

india,month,How does corruption cartel works in municipalities,"I recently paid a bribe of 1.1 Lakhs to Rent collector in a Mumbai suburbs ward . This was after relentlessly trying for more than 3 years  to keep my premises in annex-2 compensation eligible list.

Long story short, my shop may  go for demolition as there is a plan for road widening., for the same thing compensation has to be paid By government.

I am paying property tax for the same shop since 50 years as it was owned by my Grandfather before.

Only glitch was that despite his death, it was not transferred due to dispute between my father and his brother.., later on they made that one shop into two with a Deed but same was not transferred in the property tax and the tax receipt was same for both.

When annex-2 came , for one reason or other all other shops in the vicinity were declared ineligible for any compensation.
Later on some of them cut a deal with a known middleman who works for this BMC guys , all of them almost paid close to 2-2.5  lakhs and their premises was declared legal in annex-2.

I tried all routes including filing RTI, complaint letter and others , after getting inside I came to know that the said rent collector is just a collection agent but a bit ruthless in dealing with bribes ., he has the reputation to extract 200 percentage more than others., he has been suspended but again joins the service.

I do a job which requires me to stay outside India for more than 6 months and my shop is on rent , I really did not have the capacity to fight for this , I tried to talk with a family lawyer who said that 'Bina setting ke yeh kaam nahi hoga and if you involved lawyer , politician, agent  unnecessary usko bhi cut dena hoga'. He advised me that you directly talk with the rent collector, these guys are cautious to take bribes from people like me , but if you go there 4-5 times and give a hint he will open because in many such cases the real bank is made by the middleman.

I did the same and this guy finally opened up and said to me that since you haven't transferred the property tax since 20 years so fine itself is more than 2 lakhs, with a bit of negotiation he came down to 1.1 lakhs one time payment ., he told me ki mujhe upar tak khilana padta hain, from the body language I can make out that he actually got a good sum as he deal directly here , I was also happy because other shopkeepers paid 2 lakhs and above for the same job.

I paid him but I saw during payment he went outside the office and opened his drawer ,he told me to put the money in the drawer . That office has more than 15-20 people working and it seems this is how bribery works like you do not take cash in hand.

For the first time I saw that how shameless these people are , the moment he got the money his tone changed he became very soft., he processed my file and made a new list on the very next day.

Now this is first step, from what I know once they start the process I have to give more to get the choice of premises and for that the bidding happens as per the area.

I am actually interested in how does this whole cartel works as on the top of food chain is usually a politician. But in a unelected body like BMC, who is sitting at the top .
Like let's say this rent collector collects close to 25-30 lakhs a month, ultimately how much he will earn and the share after dividing between multiple sahabs ,what would be the approximate final amount the top politician actually gets .Do local nagarsevaks and MLA get any pie here ?

For eg. , in a police station the final share gets to home ministry or sometimes CM also takes as ultimately he can reject any transfer order

india,month,"Dear India, help us raise funds for my uncle's ongoing Decompensated Liver Cirrhosis, Acute Kidney Disease Treatment and sudden hospitalizations (Kindly comment and repost for better reach)","Hello everyone,

I'm reaching out with a heavy heart to ask for your immediate and very kind support for my uncle, **Santanu Roy Chowdhury**. His medical situation has become dire, and our family is at a breaking point.

My uncle was diagnosed with **Stage 4 Liver Cirrhosis** about 2–3 years ago. This was the devastating result of a long battle with diabetes, which had already severely damaged his eyes and kidneys. For years, the cost of managing these chronic conditions has been overwhelming, exhausting our family's savings.

To make matters worse, his wife (my aunt) is a **cardiac patient** who also requires continuous medication to stay out of the hospital.

This year has been especially cruel. My uncle has been hospitalized **three times** already - once for a blood transfusion, once for pneumonia, and most recently for an acute liver crisis. The cumulative cost of repeated tests, specialist visits, and essential medicines has drained every last resource we had. The situation is so desperate that we recently had to bring him home after an 8-day hospitalization because we simply couldn't afford to keep him there any longer.  
  
His condition is deteriorating rapidly. During his last hospitalization, he suffered from a recurring **Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP)**, and doctors had to remove about **8.5 litres of ascites (fluid accumulation)** from his abdomen. Unfortunately, the fluid is quickly redeveloping. The doctors have made it clear: he will need to be hospitalized every time the ascites increases.

Right now, his:

* **Liver and Spleen are severely enlarged.**
* **Kidney function is minimal.**
* **Ascites continues to build up.**

We’re caught in a terrible cycle: every time the ascites is drained, his **creatinine (a marker of kidney damage)** increases. The ultimate solution, the doctors suggest, is a **dual liver and kidney transplant**, a long and incredibly expensive process. At 60, we are terrified of how little time he may have left without this life-saving procedure.

While we await definitive written confirmation for the transplant to start a targeted fund, **we urgently need to raise ₹10,00,000 (Ten Lakh Rupees)** to cover his basic, ongoing treatment for the next three months.

This fund is crucial for:

1. **Life-saving Medicines and Repeated Tests.**
2. **Specialist Doctor Consultations.**
3. **Unavoidable and Repeated Hospitalizations** as his condition worsens suddenly.

Our cousin, his only daughter, earns just around **₹9,000 per month**, making it impossible for them to manage these expenses. We have no one else to turn to.

We promise complete transparency. All his medical reports, costs, and current condition are shared below. If the situation changes, we will update everyone immediately.

india,month,Creepy experience on metro,"It was late afternoon around 2:30pm when I was heading back home. The ladies’ coach was packed so I moved to the general coach. I was checking something on my phone when I caught this middle aged man guy staring at me. I moved a bit farther away, hoping he’d look away, but a few minutes later he was STILL staring. This time I glared back thinking he’d stop but he shamelessly maintained eye contact like nothing was wrong! Then an elderly man got on and stood between us, which felt like a tiny relief. The creepiest part? this guy was bending over, trying to peek. Soon after, my station came and I quickly got off. Even as I walked toward the exit and up the escalator, he turned and kept staring through the train window until it left. By far the worst metro experience I’ve had!

Lately, reading about all the rising rape and harassment cases in India makes me even more uneasy. It feels like some people be it pedophiles or harassers act completely without shame or fear, and that’s terrifying. Experiences like mine aren’t isolated; it’s a reminder that we need to stay vigilant and look out for each other.

india,month,What happened to the workers strike?,"On July 9th, 2025, the workers of India have joined for a general strike against the anti worker class laws of the present BJP government. They have declared a ""Bharat Bandh"" and that is all I got to hear, no other news on it. Until today when I saw an old reel on Instagram regarding this. 

Indian worker class is the largest in the world and yet, I have heard nothing about this strike in which apparently 25 lakh workers protested. I can't find many articles on it and most reddit posts regarding it are also not popular.

All of this makes me wonder, as a predominantly working class nation, we are being exploited by the rich and there is nothing we can do about it as media is also controlled by these people and we have lost a lot of worker protections (which were already low). What is the future for normal indians?

We are expected to work 10 hour days at least and commute for another hour and sleep for 8 which leaves 5 hours of which most people spend doing essential tasks like eating, cleaning etc. is this really the life we need to lead? 4th largest economy for who? And congress won't be any better either as they are also receiving the same corporate money.

india,month,Rationalism in Retreat: India's Struggle with Science and Common Sense,"India, a land once celebrated for its rich history of scientific inquiry and intellectual rigor, now finds itself at a crossroads. The rise of pseudoscientific practices, often endorsed by political figures, threatens to undermine the nation's commitment to evidence-based reasoning and rational thought. This post delves into the troubling trend of promoting unscientific beliefs and practices, particularly those involving cow dung and urine, and the political backing they receive.

**The Cow Dung and Urine Phenomenon**

In recent years, there has been a disturbing surge in the promotion of cow dung and urine as panaceas for various ailments. This trend has been notably supported by certain political figures and institutions.

* **Cow Urine as a Cure-All**: BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur controversially claimed that cow urine could protect against lung infections and COVID-19 [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gNYOAQm3aE&utm_source=chatgpt.com). Such statements have been widely criticized by medical professionals for lacking scientific basis.
* **Government-Backed Initiatives**: The Uttar Pradesh government, under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, has advocated for the use of cow dung-based paint in government buildings, a move that has been met with skepticism and ridicule from various quarters [The Economic Times](https://m.economictimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/gobarnama-says-akhilesh-after-adityanath-endorses-cow-dung-based-paint-for-government-buildings/articleshow/120902509.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Cultural Practices or Public Health Concerns?**: In some regions, individuals have been seen bathing in cow dung, a practice believed by some to purify the body. While rooted in tradition, these practices raise significant public health concerns, especially when they are promoted without scientific validation.

**The Role of Political Endorsement**

The endorsement of such practices by political figures lends them an air of legitimacy, making it challenging to distinguish between cultural tradition and scientifically unsupported claims.

* **Political Leaders as Proponents**: Statements from leaders like Pragya Singh Thakur and Yogi Adityanath have brought these practices into the political mainstream, often overshadowing expert opinions and scientific scrutiny.
* **Institutional Support**: The promotion of cow dung and urine as beneficial substances has found support in various government-backed initiatives, further embedding these practices into public policy.

**The Impact on Rational Discourse**

The growing acceptance of pseudoscientific practices has profound implications for rational discourse in India.

* **Erosion of Scientific Temper**: The promotion of unproven remedies erodes public trust in scientific institutions and undermines efforts to promote scientific literacy.
* **Public Health Risks**: Endorsing practices without scientific backing can lead to public health crises, diverting attention and resources from evidence-based medical interventions.
* **Cultural Sensitivity vs. Scientific Integrity**: While respecting cultural practices is important, it should not come at the expense of scientific integrity and public health.

**Conclusion**

India stands at a critical juncture. The intertwining of politics and pseudoscience poses a significant challenge to the nation's commitment to rationalism and scientific inquiry. It is imperative that citizens, educators, and policymakers work collectively to uphold the values of evidence-based reasoning and critical thinking. Only through such efforts can India hope to reclaim its legacy as a beacon of scientific advancement and rational thought.",30,2,2025-10-20,Artistic_Virus_3443,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1obv2bg/rationalism_in_retreat_indias_struggle_with/
india,month,High beam on roads,"Why is there no restriction on vehicles for following modifications in majority regions of India -

- Extremely high beams which cause other side drivers difficulty to drive and even take right action which leads to accidents.
- Why do we not drive low beam inside city ?
- Are thin black films allowed on car window glasses to make them VIP vehicles even though they are not ? 
- Sound of horns in Indian vehicles so much high decibel.
- Driving in opposite lanes and blocking main lanes drivers.
- Signals should remain active throughout the day and night no orange lights in night time this leads to violations of traffic.
- Speed Limits on School buses, public transports as they create a lot of chaos on roads under the name of students and public.
- Rules for ambulance as they drive sometimes terribly wrong. Though acceptable but not in such a way that leads to problems to others
- Government vehicles break rules so what can we expect from public

india,month,Has India’s idea of political unity evolved with changing media and identity politics?,"I have been wondering how the meaning of political unity in India has changed over the decades and whether what we are seeing today is just an extension of older patterns or something fundamentally new. Since independence, political mobilization here has always drawn upon identity, whether caste, religion, region or language. That is part of the country’s democratic DNA, a side effect of its enormous diversity. Yet the way identity plays out in public life seems very different now. What once operated mostly during elections, when leaders would appeal to certain communities or regions for votes, has turned into something more continuous. The lines that used to fade after polling season now remain active through television debates, social media trends, WhatsApp forwards, influencer content and even everyday conversations. It feels as if polarization has shifted from being a temporary tactic to becoming part of the cultural atmosphere itself. This change might not be about any single party or ideology but rather about how new forms of communication have altered the rhythm of politics. When news is consumed in real time, every minor disagreement can be turned into an identity question, and the old idea of consensus begins to look slow or weak. Political campaigns no longer end when the votes are counted because the narrative machinery keeps running year round, shaping how people imagine the nation and who belongs within it. Whether this is simply an unavoidable consequence of mass media and algorithmic amplification or a deeper ideological evolution in how we see community and difference is hard to tell. India’s unity has always been noisy and contested, but perhaps what is changing now is the intensity and permanence of those contests. The tools that once helped hold together a vast, argumentative democracy are the same ones now making every argument louder. Maybe that is not decline but transformation, a sign that political identity in the digital age never really sleeps.",1,3,2025-10-30,Artistic_Virus_3443,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1okaqo0/has_indias_idea_of_political_unity_evolved_with/

I am 25 year old guy living in Hyderabad with my senior citizen parents. I have an elder brother who works in IT and live in the US along with his wife and kids. My father is a retired govt employee and gets monthly pension. I am the youngest one and no sisters. We live in our own house (not flexing😅). I plan to get married by 2027-2028.


I am a mechanical engineer working in the technical sales of acoustic products for dubai-based firm. My job is a remote one but I have to go to office. It’s been one year and I am already exhausted with my job. No learning about the technical side of the products. No WFH policy. Team leader makes a scene when asked about wfh or leaves. Recently, They complained about me to HR behind my back about an issue which was solved 2-3 months back.
I want to quit and take a break.

I want to change my field to BIM (building information modelling). Its like a digitisation of Construction projects. There’s good scope of it in the GCC, EU and rising adoption in India. I want to work in this field and start one of my own agency by the age 45-50 (if I am alive haha). There are remote job opportunities as well in this field.


I want to take a break and pursue it as I am not able to balance it with my work (3 hrs overall commute, 10:00-7:30pm shift, though Saturday is off but you are already exhausted with the week and you have household chores to look after). My friends and my family are not okay with it as it might leave a bad impression on my resume and will be difficult to justify to HR.


I need a second opinion on this.

india,month,"LG India refrigerator not working since start of October — endless delays, no real update (Escalation No. VCP251017056644)","
Hey everyone,
I’m honestly frustrated with how LG India has been handling a simple refrigerator repair, and I’m sharing this here hoping someone from LG or anyone who’s faced a similar issue can suggest what else I can do.

Back in early October, my LG refrigerator stopped cooling. I raised a complaint (RNP251001000516), and after a few days the technician said the circuit board was faulty and replaced it (RNP251009037072).
But right after replacement, the cooling stopped completely — basically, it became just a storage box.

I raised the issue again, and they said the new board itself was faulty and that they’d ordered another one. Since then, every call I make gets the same reply:

> “We’re checking if the part is available.”



At one point, they even told me it would be fixed by 27th October 2025, but now they’re saying the part hasn’t arrived yet and will take another 3–4 days. It’s been over a month now, and my refrigerator has been completely non-functional this whole time.

I’ve tried calling every number they’ve given — most are either busy, not reachable, or just don’t call back. The service and communication have been terrible, and it’s honestly shocking coming from a brand like LG.

In this age of AI and instant logistics, how does it take weeks just to check the availability of one part?

Here are the details for reference:

Escalation No: VCP251017056644

Complaint Nos: RNP251001000516 / RNP251009037072


If anyone has contacts for LG’s higher management or has gone through the grievance or consumer court route successfully, please let me know. This whole experience has been exhausting.

india,month,Part 2 of Child marriage a dark reality of 2025 - deep insight of my community.,"In my last post, I got to know that people want to talk about child marriage.Here is the post - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/s/eLI0o4c5iC

Now I will give you a deep insight into my community and how they are manipulating laws. They have created a way in which, instead of marrying at a younger age, they do engagements whenever they feel the right time has come. The age can be anywhere from 1 month to 10 years, and when they attain legal age, they perform the marriage ceremony. In between the time of engagement and the marriage ceremony, the families perform certain rituals.

It starts from the day of engagement, when the girl’s family goes to the boy’s family and gives a small token amount, and vice versa (the girl and boy don’t meet). After that, in every big ceremony of common relatives, they give some gifts to the boy and girl. Then, a ceremony is performed in which some jewelry, clothes, toys, and other gifts are given to both sides.

It means the boy and girl who are engaged are put into a bubble, a sense that they are already in an established relationship. They are given continuous stimulation through gifts from a very small age, which makes them feel happy and content with what is happening. Over this, emotional training by mothers, elder cousins, sisters, and relatives is given to strengthen the belief that it is all natural. Boys are taught that the life of a girl depends on their actions — if they earn well, she will be happy, and she will be affected by anything they do. Girls are taught to stay within limits, think only about their spouse, and learn to manage the home. The girls get education only if the boy’s side relatives allow it.

In between all this, if any party (families, not children) feels they want to cancel the engagement, then they have to discuss it in meetings held by powerful men of the community. After that, they decide an amount of settlement which ranges between 1 lakh to 10 lakh or even more.

After that, whenever the families feel it’s time to perform the marriage (not from the perspective of the boy and girl, whether they are ready or not, but from whether the families are financially ready or not), they go ahead with the ceremony. Sometimes it happens before the legal age, sometimes they wait until the legal age.

Then, after the marriage is done, the wife can’t stay with her husband until another small ceremony is performed, in which the husband’s family goes to take the wife home. Some jewelry and gifts are also offered at that time. The time between the marriage and this ceremony can range from 6 months to several years, again depending on the decision of the families.

This is happening in 2025. And bitter part is government is not updated to handle this, they only give  reports and numbers that this much percentage of decline in child marriage in this much year, but the reality is far from truth. Court doesn't recognize engagement at early age as crime. It's all going on no one is talking about this.

india,month,An engineer's perspective on a Dakla ceremony. What I saw and what I figured out,"**7 Impossible Claims, 7 Perfect Hits: How a Dakla Ceremony Almost Made Me Believe**

I'm an engineer from Gujarat. I don't believe in superstition. I believe in data, logic, and evidence.

But on one night in October 2025, I saw things that made me question everything.

120 people. One temple. Hours of daklas. Three people shaking violently, claiming to be possessed by our family goddess. And then—seven specific claims about our family history. All of them true. Every single one.

I was there. I saw it with my own eyes. And for a moment—just a moment—I believed.

Here's what I saw. Here's what I figured out. And here's why it matters.

# ACT 1: THE SETUP

**The Problem**

My extended family—250 people across five generations, spread across 15-20 houses in rural Gujarat—was suffering. Cancer diagnoses. Debt. Broken marriages. Deaths that felt too soon, too sudden.

The kind of pain that makes you search for reasons. For patterns. For someone to blame. And the answer they arrived at? Our family goddess (kuldevi) was angry. Or an ancestor's spirit was taking revenge. Or some malevolent force was haunting us.

The family elders made a decision: we'd organize a dakla ceremony at our family temple.

**The Expert Arrives**

A man was invited from a village 120 km away. His job? When dakla players perform and someone becomes possessed—by a goddess, an ancestor, or a troubled spirit—he communicates with them to seek answers. No information about our family was shared with him beforehand. This is important. Remember that.

**The Ceremony Begins**

Night fell. The daklas started.

*Boom. Boom. Boom.*

The sound was hypnotic. Relentless. The kind of rhythm that gets into your bones.

Around 120 people sat in the temple courtyard, watching. Waiting.

And then, it started.

# ACT 2: THE EVIDENCE

**Part A: The Possession**

Three people began to shake. Violently. Their bodies convulsing, heads rolling, eyes unfocused.

Two of them were regulars at these ceremonies—men in their 30s and 40s who'd been ""possessed"" before.

But the third? A 16-year-old boy who'd never experienced this before the event. Now he was shaking like electricity was running through him.

**Part B: The Number Trick**

Then came the first test.

A family member went into the inner temple, took blessings from the goddess, and wrote a number from 1 to 4 on his palm. Nobody else saw it. Not the expert. Not the possessed. Nobody.

He came back out.

One of the possessed men spoke:

**""Two.""**

The family member opened his palm.

It was 2.

The crowd gasped. I felt my stomach drop.

**Part C: The Failures**

But then... things got weird.

They tried another test. This time, selecting a specific person from the crowd. The possessed tried. And failed.

They tried again with grains of wheat—3000 to 5000 grains spread out, and the possessed had to identify which one had been marked.

They tried. Once. Twice. Three times.

Eight to ten attempts total.

Every single time: failure.

The expert's explanation? ""The goddess isn't happy yet. The connection isn't strong enough.""

The ceremony continued. The daklas kept beating. Hours passed.

**Part D: The Finale**

Early morning arrived. The sky was beginning to lighten. Everyone was exhausted.

And then, suddenly, the expert himself got possessed. Coherently.

And what he said... stopped everyone cold.

**""Whose family had an ancestor named 'Devraj'?""** (Name changed)

A hand went up. Yes. My great-grandfather.

**""Are there three people in this family suffering from cancer?""**

Murmurs. Confirmations. Yes. Three people.

**""Did someone die by jumping into a well?""**

Silence. Then a nod. Yes. Decades ago.

**""Did someone die by hanging?""**

Another nod. Yes.

**""Did an adult unmarried girl die?""**

Someone's eyes filled with tears. Yes. She died young. Seizures.

**""In whose house is there a dead tree still standing?""**

Multiple hands. Yes. Several houses.

**""Has anyone filed a false court case against a family member?""**

Uncomfortable shifting. Yes. There was a property dispute. Family rivalry. A false accusation.

Seven claims. Seven hits. Perfect accuracy.

Then, the final act: In front of everyone, the expert drank an entire bowl of Sindoor—the red vermillion powder.

He didn't choke. Didn't cough. Just drank it.

Everyone was convinced. The goddess had spoken.

I wanted to believe. I almost did.

# ACT 3: THE CRACK

For days afterward, I couldn't stop thinking about it.

Seven perfect hits. The number trick. The Sindoor drinking. How?

And then it hit me.

**Why didn't they repeat the grain test at the end?**

Think about it:

* **The 1-4 number trick**: Worked (25% chance—totally possible)
* **The people selection**: Failed
* **The grain selection**: Failed 8-10 times (\~0.02% chance—almost impossible)
* **The seven claims**: Came only at the END, after hours of ceremony
* **The grain test again**: Never attempted

If this was truly the goddess at her strongest moment—after successfully revealing seven family secrets—why not prove it definitively with the grain test?

**Because they demonstrated what was statistically achievable and avoided what wasn't.**

That's when I knew. This wasn't supernatural. This was psychology.

# ACT 4: THE DISMANTLING

**Part A: Who Were the ""Possessed""?**

Let's talk about who got possessed:

**Person 1 & 2:** Regular attendees of such ceremonies. They've done this before. Multiple times.

**Person 3:** A 16-year-old boy attending for the first time.

Here's what's crucial: **All three are members of our extended family.**

They grew up hearing family stories. **They're not faking.** They're in what psychologists call a **dissociative trance state**—a real, measurable altered state of consciousness.

**The Science of Possession States**

Research on dissociative trance states (found in religious ceremonies worldwide—from Pentecostal churches to shamanic rituals) shows:

1. **Rhythmic drumming** at certain frequencies (4–7 Hz, theta wave range) can induce altered states of consciousness
2. **Prolonged sensory stimulation** combined with fatigue lowers psychological barriers
3. **Social expectation** creates a psychological permission structure: ""It's not ME talking, it's the goddess""
4. **Suppressed knowledge surfaces**: Information you know but don't consciously think about emerges
5. **It feels completely real** to the person experiencing it

The 16-year-old wasn't faking. His brain genuinely entered an altered state where suppressed family knowledge—stories heard from elders, conversations overheard—came pouring out.

Think of it like this: hypnosis is real. Sleepwalking is real. Trance states are real. The brain is capable of incredible things. None of it requires supernatural explanation.

**Part B: The Statistical Takedown**

Now, let's look at those seven ""miraculous"" claims. I'm going to apply actual statistics to MY family numbers:

**Reminder:** 250 total people (across 5 generations from \~1875–2025), 170 currently alive, 80 deceased, 15–20 houses.

**Claim 1: ""Whose family had ancestor named Devraj?""**

Devraj is a name derived from a god, **historically common** among Gujaratis.  
Expected for our family: **1–5 people** with variants of this name.  
Asking this in rural Gujarat is like asking, “Did anyone in your English family have a John?”

**Claim 2: ""Three people with cancer?""**

1 in 9 Indians will develop cancer.  
170 living people ÷ 9 = \~19 expected.  
3 active cases = below average. Not miraculous.

**Claim 3 & 4: ""Death by well"" and ""Death by hanging""**

Suicides: 8–12% of deaths in rural India.  
Of those: 64% by hanging, \~9% by drowning/well.  
For our 80 deceased: 6–10 suicides expected.  
So 4–6 hangings and 1 drowning = statistically expected.

**Claim 5: ""Unmarried girl who died""**

Epilepsy prevalence \~5–6 per 1,000.  
250 people = 1–3 expected cases across generations.  
Young unmarried woman dying from seizures is tragic—but not rare.

**Claim 6: ""Dead tree standing""**

15–20 rural homes → almost guaranteed that some have dead trees.  
Tree mortality and cultural reasons make this **100% probable**.

**Claim 7: ""False court case filed""**

66% of Indian civil cases are land/property disputes.  
15–20 houses → multiple inheritance lines.  
A false case in an extended Indian family? **Virtually guaranteed.**

**Part C: The Ceremony Architecture**

**The Setup:**

1. Hours of drumming (theta wave induction)
2. Late night → fatigue
3. 120 witnesses → social pressure
4. Atmosphere → sensory overload
5. Failures excused (“goddess not ready yet”)
6. Successes timed for peak suggestibility

**The Questioning Strategy:**  
He didn’t state facts—he asked *questions*.  
""Whose family had ancestor Devraj?""  
This prompts the crowd to volunteer info—classic **cold reading**.

**The Barnum Effect:**  
The statements *feel* specific but are statistically common:

* Common name
* Common disease
* Common deaths
* Common disputes
* Common phenomena

**Part D: The Sindoor Drinking**

""But he drank sindoor! That's impossible!""  
Is it though?

Fire-walkers, sword-swallowers, and glass-eaters exist.  
Sindoor consumption could involve:

1. Gradual tolerance building
2. Quick swallowing
3. Traditional know-how

Painful? Yes. Supernatural? No.

# ACT 5: THE BIGGER PICTURE

**Why This Persists**

Our brains are wired for **pattern recognition** and **social proof**.  
When 120 people believe something, your brain follows.

We remember the seven hits. We forget the 8–10 failures.

**The Real Cost**

It’s not money—it’s **critical thinking**.  
Supernatural explanations delay real ones:

* Epilepsy becomes “a curse”
* Mental illness becomes “possession”
* Medicine and therapy are delayed

**Why I'm Writing This**

Not to mock anyone.  
Not to call the expert a fraud.  
But to show: **everything supernatural that night had a natural explanation.**

Critical thinking isn’t cynicism. It’s curiosity.

# CLOSING: THE REFLECTION

That night, I almost believed in ghosts. In spirits. In divine possession.

Now I understand something more fascinating: **the human mind.**

The daklas weren’t calling spirits—they were calling something within us.

Those three possessed people weren’t frauds.  
They experienced real altered states.

The seven claims weren’t miracles.  
They were statistically inevitable.

The expert wasn’t necessarily a con artist.  
He was part of an ancient system that accidentally discovered psychology.

**And that’s more fascinating than any supernatural explanation could ever be.**

Because it means *we* have the power.  
Not the goddess. Not the ancestors. Not the spirits.

Us.  
Our brains. Our pattern recognition. Our capacity for trance states. Our statistical likelihood of tragedy.

Next time you see something ""unexplainable,"" ask:  
**""What’s the base rate? What am I not seeing?""**

You might be surprised.

**P.S.**  
You’re right—I can’t *prove* it wasn’t the goddess.  
But every single thing that happened can be explained naturally.  
And when natural explanations exist, **Occam’s Razor** applies.

The goddess didn’t speak that night.

But 250 years of family history, human psychology, and probability did.

And that’s okay.

I am often complimented by how many no. of different things I did(*often because of social media only reddit that too rarely)*, pesonally am someone who loves current affairs, spends all of his freetime in analysing different news and pursue different fields(*no social media and friends*), and people around me suggest me that I give UPSC often fascinated by my knowledge of geopolitics, lifestyle, current affairs, finance, economics, tech, global affairs, people who are familiar with me, have talked with me 1-2 months, are fascinated by my knowledge(no It sounds like am boasting off, but trust me If I wanted to boast off I would do social media, but am a loser with no friends(*most of them are in metro cities, am in tier -4 suburban city*), who stays quiet, people often see me as dull good for nothing being because I am too quiet, until I become frank with them or there is opportunity for them to see my work), our mandi purchaser was the 5th and last one who yesterday suggested my dad he should send me to Delhi for UPSC(one other rice miller also suggested this because he was discussing how he is planning to export to this african country and I picked out major flaws in his plans because of my interest in global studies, also then came 1 agent who gave example of  a rich fellow, relative of him, worth 3000 crores went bankrupt due to bad investments in south africa, due to exact same flaws he failed to realise), impressed by this they both asked me did I prepared for UPSC.

Now, why am considering UPSC, I always wanted to do something of my own, didn't want wealth or loan in succession, only job even with low CTC can be respectable enough to avoid peer pressure. 

Now why I never went to route of UPSC- Chances of me getting selected are 0.0000001% with general category, and given my luck with competitive exams(scored decent in JEE, only 73% in 12th boards because I got 50 in maths, couldn't put it on recheck as I needed min. 50 to land in a decent university(which I ultimately chose), MBA waitlists also moved till #1 and it was for 2 of the top 15 colleges). Babus are the person I actively frown upon, most of them are  good for nothing Individuals who are so frustrated and constipated because of preparation that the only thing they excel in are how to take bribe, and yes most of the participants are good for nothing because most of them are preparing because they know government job is permanent(no performance checks), and I bet most of them will be fired in 6 months in any private org), or they want dahej or some sexually frustrated one need good looking chick(what a way to objectify a girl) as wife, and most of them wants bribes.

Why am considering this now, I am always worried about unsecured loans, bank(not so worried about, they can declare us NPA, and can take our collateral), but we have reputation and need to pay back to market. I can't inherit these loans its too much stress. I live in tier-4 middle class family so well no Independence, no salary which I can spend independently(questions are raised often). No friends in tier-4 cities, and most of Individuals in this type of agriculture business are guthka and chai loving street goons who can't be made friends because most of them talk nonsense. No its too late for private jobs because am too bored to go to java and leetcode again(yes am out of practice and forgot most of it), also leetcode and java without college placement cell and 2 years gap will land you 6-8lpa job in best case scnario, which is too little too late for my personal ego(upsc is different gravy it will take me away from peer pressure am even good with 3lpa if individuals around me disappear, or if I could change the country and vanish).

Now coming to your question, I am feeling a dilemma, should I go for UPSC, all of the signs universe is giving is to go for it, but this means going unemployed again, on the other hand, not giving upsc means regret of had I given it regret for rest of my life.

Also, I think i might sound someone who is ridiculously boasting off, but I did it on purpose in this post, too highlight my achievements, IRL am mostly listener type, who stays quiet so much so that people ignore me, It is just that they know about my qualities when they speak to me, or am forced to speak with them, often they give me feedback that I should speak more and why am so low on confidence, so I kinda went all out in this post",0,1,2025-11-04,Sea_Olive9094,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ooetwh/dilemma_over_upsc_preparation/
india,month,The Francesca Orsini visa saga,"Ever since a UK scholar of Hindi and South Asian literature was deported, government lackeys have gone on overdrive explaining that it was nothing more than the application of law. The latest is [Swapan Dasgupta](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/shashi-tharoor-francesca-orsini-shashi-tharoors-thicker-skin-post-after-hindi-scholar-deported-to-uk-9561558) who blames some random individuals for this unfortunate situation:

>Someone snitched and flat-footed policemen did the rest.

In reality, only the top level of the central government has the ability and responsibility to investigate this kind of thing, assuming a visa violation happened at all. Meanwhile [Sreemoy Talukdar](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/laffaire-francesca-orsini-indians-apparently-still-cannot-speak-without-the-helping-hand-of-a-western-scholar-13945607.html) amusingly fills a dozen pages in explaining why deporting this person only strengthens the nation.

We are in a very concerning situation where the government maintains a blacklist of all critics, and simply denies or cancels visa at the first opportunity. You can easily find news reports of dozens of foreign academics and persons of Indian origin (PIO) who can never enter India, no matter how necessary or desperate it is for them, because they happened to have criticized the current Indian government at some time. This is a weaponization of law and executive authority - it applies only to critics of the BJP, as [The Hindu](https://archive.is/CEAze) notes:

>The argument about violations may well be true, but also evident is the arbitrariness in deportation decisions. Foreign business leaders visiting India routinely make political statements praising the government, which can be termed a violation of visa conditions.

Ever since authoritarians like Trump learned that deporting and barring people is an executive function that does not really depend on due process, they have been using it to get rid of vocal critics. We are doing this too, though a [high court order](https://archive.is/ZAfJt) said that objectivity and due process must apply:

> ... though the State can deny entry to a foreigner, the decision should pass the test of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. This should be enforced especially in the case where the foreigner is a person of Indian origin, and is given certain rights like the right to have a lifelong visa, unless cancelled in accordance with the law.",10,0,2025-11-03,xugan97,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1on3242/the_francesca_orsini_visa_saga/
india,month,Why Regional Parties in India ALLIANCE Should Push for US-Style Federal Model,"Historically, India’s federal structure was made with a strong central govt for a reason. Back then, unity was everything—avoiding partition or conflicts between states with different languages, religions and cultures. A powerful centre was seen as the only way to hold the country together.

But today things are different. India is more mature politically, economically, and socially. States have grown their own identities and governance capabilities. Regional parties, which directly represent local people, have a big role to play in shaping India’s future.

Maybe it’s time to rethink the power balance. A US-style federal model, where states have more autonomy and the centre only handles really national stuff, could help India:

Better local governance: States can make policies that actually work for their people instead of waiting for central rules.

Political accountability: Regional parties would be more responsible to the people of the state.

Less political tension: Clearer division of power means fewer fights between centre and states.

Experimentation in governance: States can try new ideas like “laboratories of democracy” without waiting for central approval.


In short, the old reason for a strong centre isn’t the same anymore. Regional parties should lobby for a federal model that matches India’s diversity and maturity today. It could be a big step toward a more balanced, dynamic India where human right are respected at every level.",0,3,2025-10-18,Standard-Fig1910,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1o9pr2c/why_regional_parties_in_india_alliance_should/
india,month,The Cycle of Corruption: From Need to Greed in India,"I think that when a government official first takes a bribe, they might do it to help their family or make their family’s dreams come true, mainly because life is tough and they need to get by in India. They tell themselves that taking the money is a must\*\*-\*\*do, a basic way to survive.

But once they are comfortable and survival is no longer an issue, they usually don't stop. The act changes from something they *needed* to something they *want*—it becomes simple greed. This happens because they get used to taking bribes, and they notice that nobody is checking up on them much, and everyone treats the bad behavior as normal.

To truly stop this, a leader has to do two things. First, they must make life easier for all citizens, making sure that honest, hard-working people can easily succeed and fulfill their dreams. Second, they need to focus on teaching strong goodness and values (morals and ethics), telling people clearly that stealing and taking bribes are wrong.

I believe this complete plan is the only way to end corruption for good. If we don't fix the main problem of why people start, corruption will just find another way to happen. What do you think?

india,month,Some advice for those looking out to building a career in law,"If you are building a career in law, you need to know this. 

The legal sector is growing, the pay is excellent and that is a fact. But at the same time it is not growing at the rate we are producing lawyers, 2 lakh lawyers every year. The top tier firms about whom you read in the papers have maybe 1,000 vacancies, and most graduates struggle for years with low pay and minimal prospects. But the usual explanation is just oversupply, too many lawyers chasing too few jobs.

That is but only part of the bigger reason, the real problem is structural. 

Indian legal education is designed in a way that almost guarantees most graduates won't be practice ready. It's not about talent or hard work, it's about how the system itself is built, and it is built in a manner that people from 2nd generation or more get massive advantage.  There is even published research on Indian legal education and the research argues that our system suffers from what they call inverse regulation. The Bar Council of India and UGC are obsessively prescriptive about inputs. Which courses you must take, how many credit hours each needs, what specific topics must be covered, library specifications, faculty ratios, even assessment methods, micromanaged to death.  But there's zero clarity on outcomes. No articulation of what a law graduate should actually be capable of doing. No definition of what skills or values they need. Just detailed rules about the process with no vision of the goal.

Compare this to the American system where the Bar Association defines clear outcomes (graduates must be ready for effective, ethical, responsible practice) but gives schools flexibility in how to achieve that. Clear goal, flexible pathways is the American approach and India does the exact opposite with hyper detailed pathways, zero clarity on goals.  Why does this matter practically? Because it creates what the study calls a theatrical education system.

One such example is clinical education which is mandatory in India, every law school must offer it, but this study found  that it's essentially fake. There's no provision in BCI rules for supervisory attorneys to guide students in actual cases, so clinical education is just simulations and moot courts. Students pretend to be lawyers rather than learning under supervision in real matters.

Or consider the complete separation between legal practice and legal academia. BCI rules prohibit salaried employees from practicing law. Sounds reasonable until you realize the consequence. Law professors can't practice and practicing lawyers who want to teach full time must give up practice. This results in what researchers call a China Wall between academia and profession, and the industry academia gap increases and student lose the benefit of having an education which helps them apply their education to real world scenario. 

In the US apparently there's constant movement between practice and teaching. Practitioners become professors, professors consult, adjuncts bring real world experience. In India, total divorce, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, Prabhash Ranjan and other acclaimed scholars have written about it but regulator remains unmoved. The people teaching law have no connection to how law is actually practiced and the people practicing have no role in shaping legal education.

All this means students learn legal theory in a vacuum disconnected from practice realities. Ethics and professional responsibility feel academic and irrelevant and when students enter practice, the ideals they learned seem remote and unrealistic. This leads to what the researchers call moral deconditioning, where lawyers become cynical and opportunistic rather than professional.

There's also zero systematic training in practical skills. Negotiation, client counseling, managing cases, even things like emotional intelligence for handling stress and client relationships. none of these  really needed life skills are taught in any structured way. 

Now all this eventually connects to employability and class. The study found that despite all law schools following the same prescribed curriculum, an informal stratification has emerged. Public universities produce trial lawyers and civil service aspirants. Elite public universities produce appellate lawyers. National law universities produce corporate lawyers. Not because of different training but because of class profiles, English language access, and alumni networks.  So the system accidentally sorts students into tiers based on background rather than ability. And for most of those 2 lakh annual graduates who end up in the lower tiers, they're entering practice without practical skills, without professional networks, with theory disconnected from reality, learning to be cynical rather than professional. Of course they're underpaid and struggling. The education system didn't prepare them for actual practice. Trial lawyers hardly get paid 10,000-15,000 a month not even sufficient to cover their extensive travel costs at times, forget the living costs. 

This is will be getting worse as legal services globalize as Indian lawyers now compete with and work alongside foreign lawyers who were trained in systems that do teach practical skills and professional formation. Technical legal knowledge, which is what Indian education focuses on, is increasingly commoditized. The differentiator should be professional competencies, but we're not teaching those.

Now, researchers propose a lot of fundamental reforms which you can read in the paper, will cite at the end, but whether these changes will take place or not is really beyond our control. What you can do is ensure you go to a good place to study, and ensure outside class hours you work part time basis with a lawyer, or intern with a firm so you are not compeltely dependent on your law school education to build practical skills that make you employable. Also, focus on building a personal brand, critical in making a career in law, be it law firm, trial advocacy, in house or something else. 

The study is available to read [**here**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23220058231220247) and it's a detailed comparison of Indian and American legal education systems focusing on structural failures. Also, since reading skills are indispensable to building a successful career in law, you should also read the full study, as I missed out on many of the points made there for the sake of brevity.

india,month,Should Chennai have a directly elected mayor? Our monsoon chaos makes me think so.,"The recent rains in Chennai weren’t even that heavy, yet the city practically came to a standstill. Roads flooded, traffic jammed, power cuts everywhere—it’s the same old story. A few hours of rain, and the city slips into crisis mode.

It makes you wonder if we are ever truly prepared for the monsoon. Year after year, the same promises come up: better stormwater drains, smarter planning, improved coordination. And yet, the Coovum River continues to run like a city-wide embarrassment—a sewage channel cutting through Chennai’s core, barely touched despite decades of plans and projects.

The real issue seems to be accountability. The Chennai mayor’s office is treated more like an extended PR arm of the state government rather than an independent executive body. Every initiative feels orchestrated, press conferences are choreographed, and the mayor often ends up playing the role of a city mascot rather than an empowered leader. It’s like watching the office being led around on a leash, with no autonomy to actually fix what’s broken.

What’s even more frustrating is how the state machinery uses every monsoon crisis as an opportunity for social media PR. Ministers and political heirs wade through knee-deep water for photo-ops, issue dramatic statements, and post drone shots of “on-ground inspections.” The focus is rarely on fixing systemic failures—just on crafting the right viral moment. While citizens slog through flooded streets, the ruling class turns disaster management into a brand campaign.

In countries like the UK and Canada—both parliamentary democracies like India—cities have directly elected mayors who possess genuine authority. London and Toronto, for example, give their mayors real mandates to plan, execute, and be held accountable by the people, not the ruling party machinery.

Maybe it’s time Tamil Nadu, and India at large, considers doing the same. A directly elected mayor for Chennai could bring much-needed political independence and real accountability to urban governance. Or is that too much power for state governments to ever willingly give up?",6,0,2025-10-30,rahul1savita,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ok8qxp/should_chennai_have_a_directly_elected_mayor_our/
india,month,"UPI e-mandate fraud risk: KukuFM tried auto-debit during trial, Google Pay couldn’t cancel, HDFC refused, RM hung up. Where’s consumer protection?","Sharing my experience because this is a serious consumer protection issue in India, and the banking/UPI system needs accountability.

⸻

Chronological Timeline

✅ Day 1 — Started KukuFM trial
Within 2 hours, I got an SMS saying:

₹499 will be debited at midnight

The trial hadn’t even completed — they tried charging immediately.

⸻

✅ Attempted cancel via Google Pay
Google Pay showed:

“Something went wrong”

Then I received an SMS from HDFC:

HDFC Bank: UPI Mandate cancel failed — Device Fingerprint Mismatch.

I did not switch phones — this message makes no sense.

⸻

✅ Tried contacting KukuFM
Their app chatbot only says “Cancel via Google Pay.”
Their phone IVR says “Cancel in the app.”
No human support. No reply to email. No cancellation button.

To protect myself, I moved all funds to another account.

⸻

✅ Contacted Google Pay Support
They said they are “investigating.”
After 2 days — still no answer.

I even told them I sent a formal cancellation email + final warning to the merchant (I included a legal-style demand email — very clear and firm).

Still, they said:

“We don’t know why this is happening, we are checking.”

No timeline. Just limbo.

⸻

✅ Contacted HDFC Bank
Their response:

“Only merchant or Google Pay can cancel. We cannot stop it.”

I explained:
	•	Merchant not responding
	•	Google Pay clueless
	•	This is a fraud-risk situation

They repeated same answer like a script.

⸻

✅ Today — Follow-ups
Google Pay support again said:

“Hopefully it will get cancelled.”

I asked:

“So I’m supposed to wait forever for your ‘hopefully’? Where is a resolution deadline?”

They disconnected.

I called HDFC again. Same reply:

“We can’t do anything. Only merchant/GPay.”

⸻

✅ Escalated to HDFC Relationship Manager
Her unbelievable statement:

“This kind of fraud happens often. It happened to me too. Bank can’t do anything.”

A banker openly admits the system is helpless.

I said:

“So banks can’t stop unauthorized debit even when customer reports immediately? That’s why fraudsters operate freely in India.”

She got offended, said:

“Go to the branch if you want help,”

and hung up.

If I have to go to branch for everything, why assign a Relationship Manager?

⸻

Current situation

✅ Merchant ignoring
✅ Google Pay “investigating” forever
✅ HDFC refusing to cancel mandate
✅ RM disconnected my call
🚫 Cannot deposit my own money safely
⚠️ Risk of AMB penalty

I also emailed HDFC formally stating I am not liable for AMB penalty because the bank’s delay forced me to keep account empty.
And I forwarded my formal demand email to bank showing I already warned KukuFM legally.

Still no action.

⸻

Key Problem

India has no “stop payment” option for UPI e-mandates, unlike cheques.

A mandate is customer consent, so why can’t the customer revoke consent instantly?

Right now:

Fraudster triggers mandate ➜ Bank can’t stop ➜ UPI app clueless ➜ Merchant ignores
Consumer has zero control over their own bank account.

How is this acceptable?

⸻

My questions
	1.	Can banks legally refuse to cancel UPI mandates on customer instruction?
	2.	Isn’t this a huge vulnerability in Indian fintech?
	3.	Can bank charge AMB penalty when I am not able to deposit due to fraud-risk?
	4.	Anyone has resolution steps or legal references?

I am filing complaints with:
	•	HDFC Nodal Officer
	•	RBI CMS portal

Not stopping until this is escalated.

⸻

TL;DR

UPI mandate got stuck.
Merchant didn’t cancel.
Google Pay can’t cancel.
Bank says “we cannot stop it.”
RM admitted fraud is common + hung up.
My money held hostage — can’t deposit, can get penalised.

This is why fraudsters are confident in India. The system gives them the advantage.

⸻

If anyone has dealt with this or knows the regulations, please guide.

india,year,The reality of make in india,"It's comical how uncompetitive and unattractive india is to make large scale investments as a corporate, especially capital intensive investments - which is basically most of infra, manufacturing, Pharma etc.

Our government wants that all these things should be made in India, and investments should be made towards them. It's no secret that capital intensive projects have long gestation periods, lengthy paybacks and lots of approvals/red tape.

In India, anything less than a 5 year payback is literally not viable. A 5 year payback = 14.87% return. No bank is lending at less than 8.5% interest for corporate loans unless you are really huge and have great negotiating power. Factor in inflation of 5-6%, and you're already pretty much in the red.

Most large scale projects though do not have 5 year paybacks on a standalone basis. It is usually longer. However, these investments are required to boost overall infra and the country's industries. So these investments are only possible through systemic and government support, where proper incentives are given without strings attached.

Unfortunately, in our country this is almost absent. Forget support - there are only hurdles. Red tape and corruption that slows you down by months, sometimes years - accruing even more opportunity cost of time lost and the interest expense.

Look at China and other countries even in south east asia - their governments makes sure that such systemic support and investments are prioritised.

india,year,Indians have destroyed the image of India in foreign,"The post will probably be taken down for telling the truth.

As an Indian living overseas, I can understand the rationale behind the widespread resentment that Indians currently face, with the exception of Islamic nations.

Most foreigners don't/can't understand India as a diverse country, as no country is as diverse as India. Arguably, North/South/East India has almost nothing in common.

During the British era, only certain sections of Indians tended to go out of India.... the people who were highly educated and civilised ...Scientists, Literary giants, Classical Musicians, people who took the actual yoga to the west (Not the crap sad-guru and kamdev shit). They were highly respected everywhere, even though India was a colony...the trend continued till the seventies, eighties.

The IT boom and thanks to central government policies, certain sections of Indians started immigrating in mass to western countries .... unfortunately, such communities are historically devoid of any actual culture, intelligence, and lack basic civility for thousands of years.

The large-scale influx of uncultured individuals from specific regions of India is to blame for the destruction of India's reputation, which has reduced Indians to workers in occupations that ordinary people in other nations don't want to perform. But that's not the only problem.  However, that's not the only issue.

Here's the behaviour I have generally seen ....

1. **Public cursing**: Cursing is sometimes common in a large group of Indians in different languages, as they think foreigners will not understand, and they will get away with it. I have heard cursing in public in supermarkets, libraries, universities, and professional workplaces.  Indian professors have even admitted to observing this behavior in their Indian pupils.
2. **Claiming fake Asylum**: This is dragging the Indian passport and the country's image to the ground. I have personally seen loads of Indians doing it. They assert that the Indian government is attempting to prosecute them because they identify as LGBTQ or something else. My friend Liz was discussing one of these just yesterday. A South Indian man attempted to persuade her to write a letter of support for him because he is gay and seeking asylum, but she refused. The guy was hitting on her forever and still does.
3. **Creeping on foreign women(Or even on men from Indian women)**: You can be attracted to anyone, but you have to take fundamental etiquette, rules, and respect into account. Desperation for sex or residencies is not okay ....they are also human beings. I have seen men taking pride in crpping women out (IIT educated guy), an Indian girl pressuring their boyfriends for a hasty marriage to settle. Then you see the 5000 for Russians is common talk among North Indians.
4. **Nepotism:** Now, although it's common for every community/country, it hampers the integration and creativity in the workplace.
5. **Being Dirty**: You can cook Indian food at home and still not smell like it if you put in an effort. Basic hygiene standards must be followed either in India or abroad. Every time I searched for housing and went to see a place that Indians previously/currently occupied, it was a disaster. Smelly, dirty, unclear food plates, ovens, and hobs that never get any cleaning, unkempt rooms, so so much more to describe. I'm not sure why, even in India, my parents instilled in me the value of cleaning up after myself, and I've worked hard to maintain every location I've lived incredibly fresh and clean.

Such behaviours turn everyone against Indians, and now, if they find out a decent Indian, most people can't fathom how that's even possible. I recall one of the Indian professors at uni was voluntarily talking about his PhD in a top Uni in Canada, and how Indians ruined the atmosphere and incited Canadians to oppose Indians. Then there's the top brass of power-hungry Indians supporting anti-vaxxers, anti-women ideologies, casteism in a foreign land, promoting vegan cultism, blocking roads to celebrate religious/cultural festivals, and so much more.

Most Indians try to switch to Indian languages if they see another Indian person, even if the others are foreigners and can't understand them. That's bullshit. Westerners always apologize, try not to speak in a different language while in a mix of people.

Indians need to understand that just because you are from India, that doesn't make you entitled to behave like my closest friend from the very first meet.

Edit: To the idiotic baffons who make everything about caste. Let me tell you, India is larger than regressive casteist spheres. I always had friends from all castes and religions. We ate together, shared the same plates, and everything else like regular human beings.

Learning basic civility, being cultured isn't that hard. The majority of typical Indian ghetto behaviours are by Gujrati, Punjabi, Harianvi, Delhi, Telegu, and extended cow belts. A few years back, I remember a few Australian universities partially banned students from certain Indian states.

If you aren't a complete idiot, you would have understood that certain actions create resentment and propagate negative stereotypes. After a while, that resentment turns to violence. That's why these days, even random attacks against Indians are becoming common, not that I am supporting it.

 The majority of you don't even read history properly. One of the distinguished freedom fighters, Bipin Chandra Pal (Lal-Bal-Pal), once said,"" Sadly, we want political freedom from the British, but when it comes to social values and reform, we have to look up to them"". Unfortuanaly that's the reality of India, people care about education, get educated, earn money, but fail to become civilised on a large scale. 

Rape is a big problem in India, which also hampers India's image on a global scale and makes women's lives miserable.  Every dimwit wants to get stricter punishments, which is redundant as it will never solve the problem.,but don't want naturalised relationships between men-women n India from very early stages of life. Apparently it will ruin "" Typical Indian social values"", and indoctrinations to the ""great"" 2000-year-old culture.

india,year,"Booked an auto, ended up witnessing pure Islamophobia in my society.","I live in Sector 40, Gurgaon. 

Last night around 11 PM I booked a Rapido auto. The guy came in-front of  my society and called. I went down and I saw him getting interrogated by some random uncle from the society.

The driver was Muslim (you could tell from his cap and beard) and this uncle was asking him, 
Who are you? 
Why are you roaming around here? 
Show me your phone!

Like WTF? The poor guy kept saying it’s a ride, but this clown just wouldn’t stop.

I intervened and told him, this is my ride, I live here, who are you to decide who comes and who doesn’t? Where’s the rule that says Muslims can’t enter? 

He started giving me gyan about trust
and safety, and I told him, 

Bro, this is Rapido, everything is tracked. I’m more scared of nosy pricks like you than the driver. Then I left with the driver.

Now maybe he’ll go cry to my landlord, but honestly I don’t give a damn. If this society thinks like him, I may relocate.

I am from Kerala, and I have never seen this kind of shit before. 

People always say intolerance is rising in India and I used to think maybe it’s exaggerated, Nope. 

Imagine having to prove your damn existence to random strangers every night just because of your religion to make the ends meet, that’s the reality some people live in. And it’s l disgusting.

india,year,"Perspective of a corporate job Indian Muslim, surviving India","Hey everyone, I wanted to share something personal. A lot of people in the Hindu community might not really know what day-to-day life feels like for Muslims in India, especially those of us who are educated, working in MNCs, or just trying to get by. I’ll also touch on the lives of many who do self-employment or menial jobs.

For most Muslims, life is very middle class or lower middle class. It’s about making ends meet, sending kids to school, and hoping they get a better future. Just like most families across India. But neighborhoods with higher Muslim populations often face systematic neglect. Sewage systems remain unchanged for decades, overflowing every monsoon. Garbage collection is patchy at best, and residents often pay out of pocket to a garbage collection man. Power and utility management is overlooked. Slowly, a neighborhood becomes a slum — not because the people don’t care, but because the system doesn’t. And when residents complain, things rarely move once it’s tagged as a “Muslim area.”

Then comes college. An average Muslim student, just 18, wants nothing more than education and a chance to uplift his family. Instead, he hears taunts: *“jihadi,”* ""university ko bomb se uda de, sab pass ho jayenge"" *“bomb the university and we’ll all pass,”* ""tumhe to ISIS join karna tha na, yahan kya kar rahe ho"" *“why aren’t you joining ISIS?”* No matter how hard he tries to prove himself, in everyone's eyes he's already a terrorist/anti national, a man who can never really assimilate into the community.

If he pushes through and lands interviews, sometimes offers vanish once the recruiter or interviewer gets to know that the candidate is a muslim. Even when he gets the job, that’s not the end. Some seniors or colleagues throw underhanded or double meaning taunts and remarks or make the environment hostile. You can’t always report it either — because you risk losing the job and starting the discrimanatory process all over again. So you keep your head down, swallow the insults, and try to move on. Not all is bad though, some colleagues are wonderful and supportive — but it hurts when even they go silent when remarks on you get thrown around. You wish someone sided with you but nobody really does. So you have to take the insults and ignore it.

Then comes housing. Landlords reject you outright. Some do it subtly (*“only vegetarians allowed”*), others say it plainly. The ones who do agree often hike the rent 20–30%. Which leaves many Muslims stuck in the same neglected neighbourhoods they wanted to escape through education and jobs. Like a perpetual cycle

And when projects like the Halal Housing community in Mumbai are launched to give Muslims dignity and a cleaner environment, opposition rises instantly. It honestly feels like *“jeene bhi nahi denge, marne bhi nahi denge.”*

From education, to work, to housing — each step forward pulls you back. That’s the survival of the common Muslim man in India. Not a threat. Not an enemy. Just someone trying to live, in the shadow of a hate-driven separatist environment created by the BJP.

Me and you — we’re not that different. We both want stability, dignity, and safety. So ask yourself: would you still believe that Muslims are a threat to this nation if you lived this life? Would you live a happy life in you were in my shoes and be proud that you were born in India ?

This isn’t a rant. It’s a perspective. An attempt to open a window into a life many don’t see.

Signing off. Take care.

india,year,"Making a school mgmt app, and my dad says it's ""not worth it"" in India. (I'm 15)","Hey, I’m a 15 year old, in class 11 CBSE, and I’ve been doing web development for a while. You can check my portfolio at antinity\[dot\]me to see the kind of work I do.

Recently, I had this idea to create a complete school software platform. It would handle automatic fees, homework, reports, attendance, calendar, and announcements, all in one, and even more than what any school offers till date. I want it to have a clean design, bots, mobile access, and an overall experience that feels modern and not outdated like most schools are stuck with.

I’ve planned everything in detail. But here’s the issue:

\- My dad thinks it’s not worth it. He says schools won’t use it because they are often corrupt, lazy, and prefer offline mode for payments and wont maintain such app.  
\- Most big schools already use ERP systems from established companies and likely won’t take a product made by a student seriously.  
\- Even if small or mid-sized schools are interested, they might not pay. They might even ask for the source code or expect everything for free.

I still want to do this project because it will teach me backend skills, real SaaS concepts, and possibly open doors for more freelance work, building my portfolio, or internships. But it’s a significant time commitment. If it won’t receive even basic usage or feedback, I’m not sure if it’s worth doing now.

So… I’m just asking here, both teachers and students, please answer these:

1. Is this idea worth pursuing in India right now?
2. Would anyone (teachers, students, developers) consider using or testing something like this?
3. Or should I change direction and build something entirely different?

I appreciate honest opinions. I’m not here to sell anything. I just want a reality check from people who understand the Indian education system or tech scene better than I do.

india,year,"In the wake of Pakistan's actions and Operation Sindoor, let's act rationally with muslims.","Just had a talk with my family over dinner. There's a muslim woman in my society who is constantly slandered behind closed doors by my parents. And today was no different. They decided to say that they couldn't trust her, and she was dangerous. Because they were speaking loudly and our door was open, my sister told them to tell them to lower their voice since someone else might hear them. And they decided to speak even louder to assert that they don't care and stand by their point.

Now, I try to argue against their islamophobia, but being 51 and 48, they're as likely to change their opinion as the sun rising from the other side of the globe.

This made me want to talk about this issue here. With everything going on with Pakistan, let's not generalise this hate to all muslim people. Every time a terrorist picks up a gun and shoots down a civilian or blows up a bomb, they are not Hindu, not Muslim, not any religion. They are not worthy of being called humans. Let's remember to not stereotype the kind-hearted and sweet muslim people with the monsters who kill people across India. If you see Islamophobia near you, simply ignore it. If they are closer to you, like someone you care about, try to argue your case logically instead of showing them aggression, because that's what they seek. I'm not telling you to sympathise with muslims, just saying that we should keep a neutral point of view to any person regardless of religion.

EDIT: I completely agree with what India did with the airstrike, and I think many more strikes like this should take place. Pakistan has harbored terrorists for years, and I'm surprised this didn't happen sooner. I simply want us not to hate Muslims because of this.

EDIT 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelming response, there are a lot of support and hate comments, I won't be able to reply to all, but thank you very much to everyone who commented.

EDIT 3: I wanted to share this because it is rich. Just peak unemployment and hollow threats after being offended by my post.

india,year,Racism from an Indian man to me (also Indian) in Canada.,"For some context I speak four languages - Malayalam, English (native & fluent), Hindi (fluent but a little rusty), and French (professional proficiency). 

I work as a Sales Advisor at a telecommunications company in Montréal, Canada (it’s a French speaking job). 

A few days ago at work, I was with a customer when an Indian man came to the store. My colleague went to him but he pointed to me and said “The Indian guy”, so I switched customers with my colleague.

And the man started talking to me in Hindi. For the record, I haven’t spoken a word of Hindi in over 2 years, and it’s tough to switch to another one of your weaker language when your brain is already cooked from speaking French straight for hours. But I spoke in Hindi, gotta do what you gotta do to make a sale you know. 

This man was quite sus, so I wasn’t really entertaining him and was staying cautious. 

Once I explained to him everything about our products and told him the prices, it was clear he wasn’t gonna buy anything. He then asked me (in Hindi) “were you born in Canada?” , I said “no, I’m from India” , “no I know, but you were born here right?” because my Hindi wasn’t perfect and had an accent ,  I said “no, I only came to Canada 2 years ago”, 

At this statement he seemed very taken aback, gave me a very judgemental look and said “oh you forgot Hindi just in two years? I would never forget Hindi even if I didn’t speak it for 10 years” , to which I said “sir Hindi is only my third language, so it’s not my best” , at this he seemed almost offended and asked me “how can Hindi be your third language?” , “because I’m from Kerala in the south, so we speak Malayalam and English” 

To which this guy had the audacity to say “ohhhhhh the south, you’re one of those * **makes random mocking sounds** * people, yeah I get it now” . And then left. 

Basically an Indian man who doesn’t even speak English, let alone French mocked my native language and my people in a foreign country 🤦🏽‍♂️ ",6210,630,2025-01-30,kittlzHG,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1idau17/racism_from_an_indian_man_to_me_also_indian_in/

As a 23 year old who always believed this country still has place for meritocracy, i feel very hopeless now. As a kid i used to believe i could make a difference through sheer hardwork and excelling in my own domain. 

What’s the point of anything now? The very foundation of “freedom” is corrupted. This didn’t even make headlines on Times Of India today. How crazy is that. Modi meeting putin(tentative )is still the main article. The media has been sold for so long.

As a young man why should i continue to believe in the system that is so blatantly rigged against me. 

I gave up moving abroad cause i had faith that India will provide. But now it feels like sunlight through a prison cell window. 

Ask around in your friend group if they can recall one major fuxk up/scam of this government. None of my friends could 😭. No govt is so perfect. 
What i’ve noticed in my friend circle is people are just so unbothered. Idk if this the case with other generations as well.

Hope i don’t go to jail over this rant jeez. 🤣

india,year,"I hate hate HATEE this country, India and my life here","I hate this country. I hate that I was born here in India. Being born here feels like a curse, at least for me. So, for starters, I’m a 16 yr old transgender boy, born and raised in India. I have several valid reasons for absolutely despising this country from the very core of my soul. Let’s begin with the people, yep, the very proud *citizens* of India. You all know how insanely diverse this country is, right? Every state is like its own little country with different cultural practices, languages, shows, etc. But here’s a list of reasons why I think this country is a failure (there are *way* more, but these ones rlly piss me off):

1. **Extreme Pride**: So many Indians, both online and in real life, have this *ridiculous* inflated sense of pride. They believe India is superior to every other country and that it’s the absolute best. In reality? It’s not lol. They’re just too delusional to see it.

2. **Racism**: Yep, racism. Indians are some of the most racist people, *especially* towards fellow Indians. If you’re dark skinned Indian, other Indians won’t hesitate to throw disgusting, racist comments at you. 

3. **Caste System**: Can we talk about how messed up it is that we *still* have a caste system? Like, in 2025? Seriously?

4. **Lack of Civic Sense**: Indians, as a whole, lack *basic* civic sense. And no, you can’t just blame illiteracy because even well-educated, wealthy people throw trash in the streets like it’s their personal garbage bin. They’re out here littering the country and then turning around to say how “beautiful” and “better than other countries” it is. The irony is painful to say the least.

5. **Judgemental Society**: Everyone's got an opinion about you and they WILL make sure you hear it. Whether it's your clothes, career choices, gender, or who you love, you're *constantly* judged, scrutinized and looked down upon. Privacy is a complete joke here.

6. **Corruption Everywhere**: Bribery and corruption are so normal here, it's practically part of daily life. Need basic services? Better know someone or be ready to pay off some official. The system isn’t broken, it literally functions like this.

7. **Glorifying Suffering**: Struggles are romanticized here. Instead of fixing problems, people flex how much *pain* they’ve tolerated. It’s always “we survived worse” instead of “we deserve better.” It’s toxic asl.

8. **Education System:** Don’t even get me started on the education system. It kills creativity, mental health, and individuality. It’s just rote learning, unrealistic expectations, toxic competition and zero space for personal growth. Nobody gives a damn about what you actually want to do. There ain't much scope for careers like architecture, art, etc. it's always either engineer, doctor or lawyer.

9. **Queerphobia/Transphobia**: Being queer or trans in India is like asking to be treated like trash. People stare, mock, misgender, harass, and dehumanize you for simply existing. It's not just strangers, sometimes it's your own family, school, teachers, doctors. Support is rare and safe spaces? Almost nonexistent in this country. 

10. **Toxic Conservatism**: This country is too obsessed with clinging to outdated traditions and moral policing. People here act like personal freedom is a threat to society. Wear what you want? You're “asking for it.” Speak up? “You're too westernized.” Think differently? “Disrespectful.”

11. **Indians are the biggest hypocrites**: Indians L.O.V.E. preaching “respect,” “tradition,” and “values” but where is that energy when women are getting harassed in broad daylight every other day? When people are abused for their caste or identity? It's all fake, performative morality.

12. **Forced Patriotism**: You can’t criticize the country without being called “anti national.” Like sorry bro, wanting a country to be better isn’t hating it, it’s expecting *basic* humanity. But people here just don’t get that. They’d rather live in denial than face the truth.

13. **Neglected Mental Health**: Mental health is either ignored or mocked in India. There aren't enough therapists, especially queer affirming ones. Public hospitals barely have mental health professionals and private help is expensive. Plus, families often dismiss it as “drama” or “attention seeking.” You're left to fight your mind alone. That's another reason why depression and suicide rates in India are rising rapidly.

Anyway, I'm done for now. There are a lot more issues I cannot mention in this post. These were just a few I've observed and personally experienced in my 16 years of living here.

Edit: 
Here are 12 more issues I've seen because some of y'all just won't sthu and accept how flawed your country really is. Someone NEEDS to speak up. :

14. **Poverty Ignored**: India LOVES showing off its billionaires and skyscrapers, but what about the millions living in slums, without any clean water or food? Poverty here isn’t just a “developing country issue” it’s a systemic failure that both, the government and society conveniently ignore.

15. **Rape Culture**: The number of rape cases reported in India is jst horrifying and that’s *just* the reported ones. Victim blaming is so common, police often refuse to file complaints and rapists walk free while survivors are shamed and silenced.

16. **Fake Democracy**: India claims to be the “largest democracy,” but in reality? Voices are silenced, dissent is criminalized, journalists are jailed and elections are full of manipulation. It’s a democracy in *name only*. 

17. **Religious Extremism**: Religion has become a political weapon in India. Hate crimes, riots and lynchings happen in the name of faith. If you don’t belong to the majority religion, you’re automatically “less Indian” in many people’s eyes.

18. **Patriarchy Everywhere**: This society still treats women like shit, 2nd class citizens. From birth, girls are told to stay quiet, sacrifice their dreams, and prioritize everyone else. Feminism is mocked and asking for equal rights is treated like a threat still. Female infanticide still exists in several parts of India. 

19. **Lack of Accessibility**: India is extremely unfriendly to disabled people. Public spaces rarely have ramps, accessible transport is almost non existent and inclusive education is a joke. It’s like people with disabilities are invisible here.

20. **Fake Progress**: This country LOVES to brag about development but it’s mostly jst surface level. A few metro cities might look shiny, but rural areas still lack basic healthcare, clean drinking water and decent roads. 

21. **Toxic Nationalism in Schools**: Kids are brainwashed from a very young age to blindly worship the country. There’s zero room for questioning history, policies or even basic facts. You’re taught to obey, not to think.

22. **Zero Work-Life Balance**: The culture here is so toxic. People are expected to overwork, underpaid jobs are normalized and taking care of your mental health is seen as laziness like I mentioned earlier. Rest is treated like a luxury, not a necessity.

23. **No Legal Protection for Queer Relationships**: Queer people still can’t legally marry, adopt, or even access basic relationship rights. The government refuses to recognize LGBTQIA+ people as equal citizens because we “don’t align with Indian culture.”

24. **Brain Drain**: Talented people keep leaving India. Why? because the environment here is so hostile to creativity, to freedom, to ambition. If you're smart and different, this country will try to shut you down. 

25. **No Sex Education**: There’s ZERO proper sex ed in most schools. As a result, kids grow up clueless about consent, safety, and bodies leading to abuse, unplanned pregnancies, and shame. It’s a public health crisis no one wants to fix. That’s also a HUGE reason why India has such an overwhelming and unmanageable population because people aren’t taught how not to contribute to it.

**Anyway, I’m done fr now. The so-called ""Indians"" in the comments are doing a flawless job proving every single point I made. It’s honestly just embarrassing and disgusting at this point lmao.**

*Edit 2* : To those saying I should just leave India, I definitely will. I’ve wanted to for a long time. But it won’t be an escape, it’ll be a choice. Like anyone else, I just want to live a good life. I know I deserve better regardless of what other ppl have to say. If I can feel welcome and find love, freedom, safety, and acceptance in another country, things my birth country never gave me, then I’ll leave without hesitation.

*Edit 3* : And to those saying my post was written by AI, I appreciate the accidental compliment lol. I guess my writing’s finally leveling up!

india,year,"I took an education loan of ₹40L to study in the US — now I’m back in India, drowning in debt, and don’t know what to do","Hi Reddit,

I never thought I’d be in a position where I’d have to write something like this, but I’m out of options and just hoping someone out there can guide me or help.

I’m from India, I took an education loan of ₹40,00,000 from HDFC Credila to pursue my Master’s degree in the U.S. My father ran a small business and, along with my family, they put in a lot they had — emotionally and financially — to help me chase the dream of a better future.

I completed my degree, but due to the economic recession, visa limitations, and lack of internship opportunities for Indian students, I never got a job in the U.S. I applied relentlessly for a year, but couldn’t even earn enough to cover my own living expenses. My family sent me money every month — draining their last savings.

Eventually, my father’s business was making losses and he fell ill. They couldn’t support me anymore, and I had to come back to India, heartbroken, jobless, and with a huge loan on my head. (Update: He’s better now and healthy)

⸻

After months of searching, I finally landed a job here in India that pays me ₹75,000/month — but my EMI is ₹66,000/month. That leaves me with just ₹9,000 as personal savings, now the business is running and it can support the family, and handle everything else. I’m trying to pick up extra freelance or part-time work, but between my day job and my father’s aging, I’m emotionally and physically drained.

I feel like my whole life will go into just surviving this crisis. We were a modest middle-class family.

⸻

I don’t know who to turn to anymore. I’m trying to contact the bank for restructuring, applied for side gigs — but nothing has worked so far. That’s why I’m here: asking Reddit for advice, guidance, or if anyone knows how to navigate the next steps further.

If you are / know any hiring manager, Recruiter who can get me an interview at a good company that would be super helpful, feel free to DM me.

I feel confident on my skills that I can crack the interview if given the opportunity. 

I did my MSc in Management Information Systems, Undergrad is in IT. I have a couple of years of work experience doing Tech Product Management, Project Management, AI consulting, Marketing and Sales.

Let me know if you have opportunities in these domains. 

If you’ve been through something similar or know someone who can help — even just to talk — I’d be immensely grateful.

Thank you for reading this far. Just being heard means a lot.

india,year,Indian Tourists in Vietnam,"I just came back from a ~2 week vacation from Vietnam and I was shook by the behavior of some Indian tourists there. Really need to vent this out, hope this is the right place.
Might be a long read, I am not filtering out or articulating.

For starters, I'm from India and I'm proud to be an Indian, I love the culture, I love the love we have, I plan to stay here for the long term even though I have enough leverage and opportunity to move out, simply because nothing can replace the feeling of being here.

For context, I went for a ~2 week tour in Vietnam very recently and just came back. It was a really good trip, there was decent footfall as tourist seasons peak in most of the places that I have been. And of course, there were a lot of Indian tourists coming with families majorly.

Most of it was smooth, but there were some things which irked me so much that I almost felt embarrassed to be put in the same pool as these people.

I don't want to go into any specific religion/language/set of people so I'll keep this generic, and I mean no offence to anyone.

First off, we took a small bus tour in Da Nang to visit Hoi An and Marble mountains. There is this group of 8-9 odd people, an Indian family which takes up the majority of the bus. They have 0 regard for the silence or peace of anyone in the group. Since they were a big family, they didn't get seats together. That ended up becoming a reason for them to stand/shout throughout the journey. EVEN WHEN THE GUIDE WAS TRYING TO SHOW US AROUND AND SPEAKING IN THE BUS. There were people from all nationalities, German, Americans, Australian, Taiwanese, and all of them were visibly irritated.
On top of this, one of the guys telling the guide to stop the bus somewhere for ""garam chai and pakode"" as it was raining, thinking this was funny whilst the guide being confused as english wasn't his native language and people struggle there.

It was clear that we'll be served Vietnamese food as part of the meal and they had separate provisions for Vegetarian Vietnamese food as well. But when that family reached the restaurant, they created a ruckus about the food and decided to leave. They told the guide to pack up the food and they'll have it later at their hotel. The guide packed 9 boxes of food and in the end of the tour, when they were getting down they left the food there saying ""ye sab kon khaayega, hum jaake daal makhani aur roti mangaa lenge"". WHAT? Why the fuck will you tell them to pack food when you knew you wouldn't want it.

Apart from this, in the last leg of the journey, they opened up chips, khakhras and what not, creating a ruckus on a 1.5 hr drive from Hoi An to Da Nang. They ended up throwing packets in the bus, spilling food and putting it up in the mini-bus pouches and trays.
When in the end I told them to atleast pick up and not trash the bus, they said and I quote ""Arre agar ye hum yahaan choddke naa jaaye toh pata kaise lagegaa ki Indians aaye the ghoomne"". 
This was the point when I REALLY wanted to smack them in the face.

Apart from this, so many places where I saw Indian tourists being extremely loud, without giving 2 fucks about their surrounding. Also gathering and eating food in places where you're clearly not allowed to (I get dietary restrictions, I am an eggetarian as well, but there's a place and time to open up your own food packets).

Also, so many times when in group tours, they'll keep the whole group waiting even when the time to gather back is clearly mentioned because they overestimate their direction sense and speed, and always want to capture everything on their camera(nothing wrong, but do it in the time frame)

This one time this husband and wife came in 7 mins late, then the guy had the audacity to step back down for one more selfie with his wife because they saw a statue on the other side. Even the tour guide was absolutely frustrated.

Another problem is people not understanding their health limitations for activities. These people get tours and vacations booked from travel agencies, whose purpose is to sell them the most activities.
They almost never do their own research as to what is feasible. We were in Hang Mua caves, which is a fairly physically challenging hike for people who are not in the best shape. We had old Indians who were trying to climb up but it was clearly not cut for them.
I really want them to hike up and wish for their good health, but some things are a stretch and there is always a line that you should be able to draw, especially if you're bounded by your own health. There's only a single file of people who can go up, so if you're slow/stuck, the entire line gets stuck. This one very passionate Indian uncle in his 70s was really struggling but was hell bent on covering it, even though everyone was suggesting him otherwise.
This isn't his fault, but doing some research and choosing the places you visit according to it is something which I have seen a lot of Indian tourists lacking. Primarily because a lot of people don't go to a country to experience it, but rather to mark it off their to-do list that they've visited one.

Also random but this one Indian uncle singing loud bhajans whilst in a boat and saying ye sab to India mein hai, ye sab dekhne thodi aaye hai whilst belittling people around, under the pretext of humor.

I cannot tell anyone to experience the city, research, try local culture, food, that's their choice, whatever floats their boat.
But please, please make sure that you're not a bad influence on the image that people have about your country. 
It doesn't take too much to be a little civil, a little less loud, showing some respect and better habits. We boast about being extremely hospitable, it'd be good if we don't come off as loud, arrogant pricks everywhere we go.

There's always a set of very well behaved Indians who guides love to interact with, talk to and joke around with. We had some really really amazing experiences.

But there's something fundamentally wrong with some people and I hope they realize it before we are all categorized in that pool.",4275,828,2024-12-17,suffer-surfer,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1hg7k14/indian_tourists_in_vietnam/
india,year,Hi. I'm a foreigner stuck in Delhi. Need help to get outta here.,"Hi. Here is my story.  It is a long one, so, if you wanna read it takes  take your seat. Hope I can find some real help here. At least this is the purpose of this post.

Im Russian guy, 26 yo, I am from Ukraine border myself originally (Taganrog,  Rostov region. It is 20km away from the Ukraine,  you can google map it if u like), and I came to India in the beginning of the war, for safety reasons. Got a student visa, to study yoga and vedic culture, and its extendable, I extended once but couldnt do it second time (there was a whole another long story. But I did not intentionally overstay here, cause I obviously didn't want to break immigration laws). So visa started to expire, then started to overstay. I didnt go back that time cause of low income (spent last everything just to relocate to India, cause was afraid of draft.)and because of forceful drafts that were going on that time (late 2022). So I had to live there, in WB, with no valid visa for a while. Again, its not thatbi wanted to overstay, I just could not prolong it. There was, unfortunately, a reason for it.

Then, on top of all that I lost my passport and documents. I got robbed basically, and whole backpack with all my docs, my military certificate, my old phone, was gone. I had to come to delhi for seeking help from my embassy. 

I came to Delhi months and MONTHS ago to get help from my embassy, but they are not VERY much helpful. (Cant expect much from Russian govt structures, if they send their own citizens to fight and die in Ukraine only for their political and economic interests.)

My embassy is KIND OF helping me, but only by giving me a temporary flight document. They dont provide neither place to stay, nor flight tickets eventhough they understand that I have no support from neither my family members, nor from old friends or anything. My own mom was informed as soon as my passport got stolen, and we asked her to send money for flight tickets and for paying my fine to frro (i didnt have money that moment. I was selling books and was only getting enough money to get by) , but she refused, although she had money. She hung up the phone on me, saying that she ""loves me"", although she was informed that i may get into serious difficulties without her urgent help. I never talked to noone from my family eversince... I always had bad relationships w them, but now i just feel as if I have no family. Anyways... 

 I'm stuck mostly because of insufficient funds and second reason is that I need to get a paper from FRRO (foreign regional registration office, or Indian bureau of immigration) called exit permit to be able to flight back. They are not giving it to me for months now. ""Your case is difficult"" , they say.

One reason for it also is that I cannot give them any residence proof document, (called C form). And that is because I literally cannot rent ANY place whatsoever. I had to live in the railway station, in the waiting area for so long that it just drove me crazy. I lost hell lot of my weight and nervous cells there. They allowed me to stay there cause i explained to local that no hostels, hotels, or landlords allow me without passport. And papers from my embassy are not working at all on them. So its a vicious circle.

At the end, when one member of their staff (just a cleaner guy) stabbed me there in the arm during the fight (he picked it), police of that new delhi railway station, pf1, just decided to throw me away because I wanted to file an FIR ( that could convince my russian embassy to finally help me with something). They didnt want to fire that guy who stabbed me, and didnt want any trouble or any scandal, so they just kicked me out. so i had to just roam around, from 1 place to another, for months after that. This is my situation even now. 

Embassy guys did look concerned when they saw me with my arm bleeding but couldnt do much still. They do not provide neither place to stay, nor, again, are very active in helping me to return back. I mean, they do whatever is there in the script of their job, and I can see that its NOT that much. :/

So, back to the exit permit... I have no passport and visa to rent any flat or room or hotel or hostel, and I need a document from the house/hostel owner, and without that document I cannot get exit permit feom FRRO🤦‍♂️. At least I cannot get it easily. That may be one of the main reasons why they take way too long in my case. I explained all of it to them ofc, and 1 worker there seemed to be understanding my situation and she offered me some way that MAY work even in the absence of C form, but she was the only 1 in the whole structure who really were getting me and understanding my situation. So its going extremely slow and dull. 
 
Now I am in the process of getting that exit permit, but it takes extremely long. I may have a chance of getting it still, I believe I just need to push them more, like, make some final push, so to speak, but I have very difficult time doing it while I am having to just always be in a constant search for place to stay, food, medicines and other bare necessities. I was hosted by few indians here in delhi, but noone can do it for long time, which is understandable. Still I need a place to stay for at least 1 or 2 months, to finalise my docs and be ready for a flight. 

Last time I got some nice place i was hosted by a guy from Meghalaya, but he had to fly to his hometown for his uni studies. And I am in the IGIA airport, in the waiting room for last 4 days as Im writing this. I have no money, and only survive here cause that guy from Meghalaya sends me something for water and some food. Rn I have 2 rs in the pocket. Couldn't contact him this evening.

Really, really hope to get some support here on reddit. At least i should try anything I can. Im a real person and this story is too. You can come meet me in IGIA in waiting area, to get to know me closer, or write me here, or by links in my profile. Even you can call my russian embassy and ask them if they know me (I'll give you my name), everyone will surely recognise me. From the phone operator up to the head of the embassy, i think. 

So why im writing here... Im trying to find some host here, even for a few days or a week, or cpl weeks. or, better, to find someone who can help me get any kind of flat, at least for 1 2 months. I need help to finalise my document shit and get back to my country. Any help with getting 

Please reach out to me if something can be done. 

P.s. yes, I tried gurdwaras. They ask for document and the only thing free there is a place on the balcony (on the street basically) and a mat. I tried living in temple too, cant do it no more. What else... yes, NGOs are also asking for documents, however paradoxal it may sound, and don't allow a foreigner w no documents in. Yes, I filed a lost report about my documents and all. No, police does not help, I spoke with too many of them. No, I cannot just get a job here (without documents) , and I don't want to be engaged in scamming or drug dealing. If there would be some other option which would work, id accept it. Didnt see any so far. 

So this is my only option rn - simply ask for help in resolving this. I am posting and writing everyone I can in my insta, in my contact list and so on - but no response at all. 

Pray and Hope this message finds someone who really would care. 🙏 

Thank you for your attention. If anything - please check my profile page. Reach me here or in insta/telegram . Any help appreciated, however insignificant. 

P.p.s: Idk why I cant attach photos here, but i do have scans of some documents and some other things to show. I uploaded them on my profile.

india,year,"Things in India that are normalized, but really should not be ","I’ve just returned to India after living for 6 years in Europe and the US, and I want to just talk about a few things that are super normalized here, but they are actually not normal. I’m not going to talk about traffic, pollution and dirt, as these are already super mainstream and known by all. But here are a few other things that are not okay with me.

1. Pets - 
Many people have pets that are not trained. A german shepherd in my building literally chewed my hand (I was wearing a hoodie). And the owners did nothing. This is not okay. If your dog is not trained, dont let it go near people, or put a leash on the mouth. Also, if you take your dogs to take a shit in the garden and on the roads, it should be your duty to clean it. Similarly, if you want to approach a pet, ask the owner for perimission because all pets are different and some may not be comfortable with that.

2. Personal events - 
Why is it so normal to cause disturbance to traffic by blocking roads because of your personal event? Also, if your party plot is near a residential area, it is your responsibility to make sure that the noise is under control. 

3. Not close relatives interfering with your life - 
I recently met some of my aunt and uncles friends, and they all asked me extremely personal questions about my relationship, dating etc. why do they not know that they’re crossing a line here? 

4. Staring -
A few days ago, I returned from a friends wedding and got off at the main gate of my society. There was a group of uncles sitting there by the fireplace. They started staring at me. All of them, together, straight up at me. I felt uncomfortable and just tried walking past them as much as I could. After passing them, I turned to look if they were still staring, and they were. I did not say anything and continued walking, but at this point, I really wish I did :( 

5. Constructions and safety:
Few days ago, I took an internal road to avoid traffic and to my surprise the whole road was dug up, with only a small way on the side, like a very small one way. There were no signs that the road is under construction and even the dug up part was left open. It wasnt that deep, but there were a lot of open ended iron rods, that if anyone fell, they would get seriously hurt. I cant imagine how old people navigate through this? Why can you not properly cover the area thats in construction? 

6. VIP treatment:
We had to leave IGI airport as our train got delayed and had to go to another terminal. So we had to exit at an arrivals gate. Many people wanted to exit, and many wanted to enter. The main guard there started shouting at the other workers and all the travellers because “some VIP is coming”. This made everything more chaotic. But I feel where the guy is coming from - he is under so much pressure because if anything goes wrong with the VIP’s arrival, his job will be at stake. But why are these VIP’s treated like this, and all others like shit???

Anyway. These are just some observations after spending a week here. I know you’ll all say ki “isme kya naya hai”, and I get it. I just needed to get it off my chest. 🫠🫠🫠

india,year,I want to leave india.,"And when I say I want to, people start protesting ""You hate your country haww, so you are just wasting our resources?"" Bitch I pay for them

You want to know why I want to leave? You want to act like questioning the state of things makes me some kind of traitor? Fine. Let's go step by step because apparently, blind patriotism is easier than confronting reality.

Let’s start with the latest outrage—the Supreme Court telling Ranveer Allahbadia that his jokes would ""make women feel ashamed."" Oh, so now we care about women’s dignity? When it’s about a guy cracking jokes, suddenly the system wants to step in and be the moral police. But when it’s about something that actually matters—marital rape? Silence. Absolute, deafening silence. You know what’s legal here? A man forcing himself on his wife, because apparently, marriage is a free pass for assault. But sure, let’s focus on jokes. Let’s spend our time on the big issues like comedy instead of, I don’t know, the fact that rapists walk free, that women have to beg for justice, that survivors are shamed while criminals get sympathy.

And since we’re talking about priorities, let’s talk about law and order in general. Every week, a new case of some rich, powerful guy committing a crime and getting away with it. Drunk drivers mowing down people? Political connections will fix it. A celebrity gets caught doing something illegal? Don’t worry, a PR campaign will clear their image. A regular person, though? Get ready to rot in the system. There’s no justice here—just a game where the rich and connected win, and the rest of us pretend we live in a functioning democracy.

But let’s not stop there. Let’s talk about the culture—because this country prides itself on being “progressive” while clinging to ideas that should’ve died centuries ago. Ever since this Ranveer Allahbadia controversy, it’s been clearer than ever that we’re not moving forward—we’re stuck. Our definition of progress is adding more shopping malls while keeping the same regressive mindsets alive. Women still get judged for what they wear. Inter-caste or interfaith couples still get harassed. Parents still control their kids like they own them, shoving them into careers they hate because “log kya kahenge” (what will people say). And god forbid you question tradition—because the moment you do, you're suddenly disrespecting ""Bharatiya sanskriti"" (Indian culture).

Let’s move on to infrastructure, or rather, the lack of it. My parents pay their taxes, but where does that money go? Because it’s sure as hell not going into roads. I don’t even live in some remote village—I live in a developed town. But apparently, ""developed"" means nothing, because the nearest McDonald's is 17 kilometers away. And sure, it’s not about McDonald's itself—it’s about how basic infrastructure is still a joke. Potholes, traffic that moves slower than a dying snail, and an internet speed that makes you question if you’re still in 2025 or if you time-traveled back to 2008.

And then there’s education. A system that rewards memorization over intelligence. A system where creativity is crushed and students are pushed into engineering or medicine like cattle, with no regard for what they actually want. You’re not taught to think—you’re taught to obey. Schools don’t prepare you for life; they prepare you to be a replaceable cog in an overpopulated machine. And if you dare to dream outside the conventional path? Good luck explaining that to your family, because in their eyes, success is a government job or an IIT degree.

Then we have the economy. Oh, you want to build wealth? Well, good luck, because if you're not born into it, you're in for a lifelong struggle. Wages are low, the cost of living is rising, and everything is taxed to death. Want to start a business? Get ready to drown in bureaucratic nonsense and corruption. Want to invest? Hope you enjoy government policies changing overnight, killing industries with zero warning. And if you somehow manage to make money, guess what? You’re still at the mercy of outdated financial policies and a stock market that swings like a drunk pendulum.

And finally, the biggest hypocrisy of all—if I want to leave, suddenly I’m the villain? Suddenly, I “hate my country”? No. I don’t hate my country—I hate what it has become. I hate that questioning these things makes people defensive instead of introspective. I hate that people refuse to acknowledge reality because it’s easier to pretend everything is fine. I hate that I have to explain why wanting a better life isn’t a betrayal.

But sure, keep calling me ungrateful. Keep telling me that ""no country is perfect,"" as if that excuses everything. Keep pretending that patriotism means blind obedience instead of demanding better. And while you do that, I’ll be making my way to a place that values progress over empty pride.

india,year,Why I hate Narendra Modi,"While most of North India chokes, I was just watching how China managed to improve its air quality by 55% in just 10 years. Then I came across stories of how it significantly reduced ground-level corruption. What made these changes possible was a central government that dared to take bold, decisive actions. 

Now, I would never trade India’s democracy for an authoritarian regime like China’s (though we are very close to it). But what pains me is this—Narendra Modi had a CCP-like decision making power thanks to his strong majority. He had 10 years to pass landmark bills that only a government with this kind of majority can. 

What could Modi have achieved?

	•	A powerful Anti-Corruption Act and update the Police Act so that citizens are not afraid of police. 

	•	A game-changing Environment Protection Law that could have let citizens breathe. 
	•	Tax Reform to Eliminate Evasion to create a more equal society. 
	•	Healthcare and Education reform so that poor kids don’t die in hospital fires and everyone gets a fair shot at life.  

Narendra Modi had the power. The people were hopeful. The stage was set for transformative policies that could have made crores of lives better.

But what did Modi choose?

We all know the answer. None of the above. Instead, we saw a focus on polarizing issues, diversionary tactics, and policies that seem designed to consolidate power to himself and his billionaire friends. 

This is why I feel so deeply disappointed. It’s not about ideology or party politics. It’s about an opportunity lost. Modi could have been the leader who defined India’s next 100 years, one whose legacy would be remembered fondly for centuries.

But instead, he chose the same old path of divisiveness, short-term gains, and power for power’s sake.

This is why I cannot support him—not because of what he did, but because of what he could have done.",3531,907,2024-11-28,GloomyPsychology5060,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1h26eic/why_i_hate_narendra_modi/
india,year,One of the things I find most disgusting in India.,"I’m a foreigner working at a multinational company, currently assigned to the India branch.

At our office, I share the restroom with local colleagues. One issue I’ve found particularly difficult to deal with is the way the toilet is used.

It appears that some people use the hand-held bidet and clean themselves with water—possibly using their hands instead of toilet paper, based on the sounds from neighboring stalls. What makes it especially unpleasant is that the used water often ends up on the floor.

Sometimes, this water—likely mixed with waste—is clearly visible and even flows into adjacent stalls. Entering a wet and soiled bathroom is extremely uncomfortable, especially when it’s caused by someone else’s hygiene routine.

I believe personal cleaning should be done in a way that doesn’t affect others. If water is used, it should be properly contained and not left to spill on the floor.

Everyone should feel comfortable using shared facilities. I hope more care can be taken to keep the restrooms clean for everyone.


P.S.
I forgot to mention—I use the self-bidet too. I wipe with toilet paper first and then use the bidet to finish. But I don’t leave water all over the floor.

This isn’t about toilet paper vs. water. It’s about basic hygiene in a shared restroom.",3272,389,2025-04-12,Ok-Wolf1809,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1jx86xi/one_of_the_things_i_find_most_disgusting_in_india/
india,year,"As an Indian in the US, it’s embarrassing how bad we are at greetings compared to Pakistanis.","I need to get this off my chest. I’m an Indian student working part-time here in the US, and every single day I greet people who walk in and out. My work deals mostly with Indians and Pakistanis. Most folks Americans, Pakistanis, others respond with a smile, eye contact, sometimes even a friendly conversation. It feels normal, human, and respectful.

But when it comes to so many of my fellow Indians? No smile, no eye contact, not even the decency to acknowledge a “hello.” They just walk past like I don’t exist, and honestly, it’s embarrassing. I’ve seen Pakistanis in the same situation they’ll smile, greet, even joke around. Meanwhile, too many Indians act stiff, cold, and awkward, as if basic politeness is a burden.

I’m not saying all Indians do this, some definitely make the effort, and it’s great when they do. But way too many don’t. And it frustrates me because it reflects so poorly on us. We already struggle with blending into American culture, and this just makes it worse. It takes literally zero effort to look someone in the eye and say “hi.”

We’re living here, studying here, working here. This isn’t India where you can just keep your head down and ignore everyone. A small greeting isn’t just “American culture”— it’s basic human courtesy. And the fact that so many of my own people refuse to adapt disgusts me. It makes me feel like we don’t even want to fit in, and that’s not okay.

india,year,India is actually a good country to live if you can live in a village ,"M 22. 
I make about ₹70k per month and work from home, so I’ve chosen to live in my village, Thirthahalli, in Karnataka. Life here is peaceful, with no noise or air pollution. While there are plenty of complaints about India these days in reddit but I choose to see the good part of where I live . For the taxes I pay, I feel I get decent facilities, like good roads even in rural areas. Sure, the heavy rainfall damages them as this is a heavy rainfall region, but potholes are usually fixed within a month. The air is fresh, and quality food is just a 2 km bike ride away in the nearby taluk town. A ₹100 biryani here rivals the taste of top Bangalore restaurants. Electricity is almost free, and people are friendly and helpful.

When I get bored, I grab my fishing rod and head to the river. Living here lets me enjoy a balanced, peaceful life while earning well. Clean air, good infrastructure, affordable food, and a supportive community make me feel like I’ve made the right choice. For me, this simplicity and connection to nature outweigh the chaos of city living. 

I lived in Bangalore for four years during my studies and hated the constant traffic. Now, living in my village, I enjoy the freedom of less crowded roads and the calmness of rural life. Being surrounded by dogs, birds, cows, and sometimes even snakes (haha) makes me feel much closer to nature. I stick to a 40-hour workweek, which gives me enough time to upskill, pursue hobbies, and truly enjoy my free time.

During engineering, I had different ambition . Dreaming of living a cozy life in a fancy Bangalore apartment and working endlessly to make a ton of money. But my perspective on life has completely changed now. It’s not that I’ve given up on ambitions like switching companies or improving my skills to earn more, but I no longer chase these goals at the expense of my peace of mind. Life here feels more balanced, and that’s what matters to me the most.

india,year,Being Indian in Europe: My Personal Experience with Stereotypes and Growing Hostility,"Indian living in Germany. Whatever I mention here is solemnly based on my experience and observations. I may not be 100% right, but I would still like to share my experience because what I experienced is 100% true.

When I first moved to Europe, I didn’t think about racism or discrimination or being stereotyped. I thought I would move abroad and, like my immigrant friends, build my life here. Now there are many challenges I have faced, but the most difficult is being stereotyped and people assuming things mostly negative about how life in India is, how unhygienic we are. Never mind that, I recently sensed growing hostility towards Indians in Europe because of our huge immigration. We are really looked down upon and called low-paid job seekers. When I travelled to Greece for vacation, it was uncomfortable. I was looked at funny or spoken to rudely by foreigners. Firstly, Greece has a good Indian/ Pakistani population, and Greeks seemed to not like us because, according to them, we are taking away their jobs in an already crumbling economy. I was mocked when I asked where I came from while I was asked to show my residence title, and I assumed they wanted to know which country I currently reside in. When I said Germany, I was laughed at and asked where I came from again. I said India, and they continued something in Greek, laughing at what I said. There were other instances in Germany where people looked at me weirdly, though not always. 

I try to blend in as much as possible. 

Westerners just want to blame Indians, whether in America, Canada, Australia, or the UK, for mass immigration and taking their jobs. They criticise our way of life, and god it is spreading on the internet too. I come across posts where people talk about how filthy we are, how awful our country is. It does hurt seeing all this hatred. I understand that some Indians don’t even try to integrate into a new country with their habits, such as speaking loudly on phones, playing music on speakers in public transport, or cutting lines, but then not everyone does it. But we are generalised as one. 

This does make me feel that if we all could collectively do better and be seen as a progressive society rather than low-paid workers eating and smelling like curry.

india,year,Indian youth is extremely radicalised.,"So I’m 17f, I’m still in school and my classmates are extremely radicalised. I had a friend circle from classes 4th till 10th but now one of them no longer wants to talk to us cuz she has be friended two girls who are extremely radicalised. I’m a muslim and my other friend is OBC. She has completely stopped talking to both of us. I tried making new friends but whenever I try to sit close to them (my other friend is in a diff. section), I have noticed that they bring up politics and straight up start justifying hate crimes. I’m from Rajasthan so when the Jaipur express hate crime happened, my fellow classmates were praising the killer for “reducing the burden” and that “anybody who doesn’t vote for [our fav party] is a burden on India.” I’m not even a bad student I’m actually the class topper. Its not like they are trying to not befriend/ragebait me cus I am “buri sangat”. They genuinely do believe in such stuff.

india,year,We bear an unfair burden of Cooking,"I grew up in North India, ate our delicious cuisine all my life, and learnt to cook decently. I always thought that Indian cuisine (I'm sorry, I specifically mean North Indian), was similarly difficult and similarly painstaking as other world cuisines. I used to believe that, making fresh roti/puri/naan and making chhaunk for each dish, and frying vegetables was standard and done in homes all across the globe.

I couldn't be more wrong. I recently talked to some American people, who showed me how ridiculously simple their home preparation food is. I am not talking about young americans who eat frozen food and fast food, I'm talking about sustainable and healthy ""home"" food. Almost nobody regularly fried vegetables and made their roti/bread, on a regular basis. Their fancy restaurant level dishes are comparable to indian home food in terms of effort.

It got me wondering, and it struck me that Indian women spend 3-4 times more time than american home food makers. Every household in India either employs one such person to cook, or the women in the family make it. And the demands and tantrums - a round roti - spices not right - not fresh - can't eat fridge leftover, it's mind boggling. I might be wrong, but it just feels that a good part of North Indian home cuisine is propped up by exploiting women.

Does long cooking time impact worker productivity? Does it unfairly hinder indian working women as compared to women outside India?",1857,407,2025-04-19,LagrangeMultiplier99,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1k2mxb5/we_bear_an_unfair_burden_of_cooking/
india,year,Corrupt Indians,"Visited india after nearly 8 years and it seems like things are just getting worse and worse. Everyone is corrupt,  there is no service that you can have without someone being corrupt.  

Passport renewal : Filed the application online,  no progress for a month.  Visited passport office, gave a bribe. Next stop police station, gave a bribe. Postal delivery guy refused to give passport and lose the mail unless he gets money.  Gave a bribe.

Driving license renewal : no driving test. Bribe the guy outside to get an appointment.  Bribe inside and the application got approved. Postal guy again needed Bribe. 

Fridge repair : official LG guy comes home. Makes a fake invoice with less cost than he charged. Started a fight afterwards. Scammed  me for the cost of parts, scammed the company by underreporting the problem. Eating money both ways. 

Taxi : You book Uber, they don't care what the app says.  Some cancel the ride and ask for cash,  other ask for extra cash on top.  

These are just few examples,  every person I've met is just trying to scam and get some extra money.  I've yet to see someone working honestly,  before it was only govt Institution now even private Institutions are corrupt. And it's all because of the people working there.

india,year,Why is there such a massive quality difference in products between the West and India?,"After living in the US for eight years and moving back to India four years ago, the massive difference in product quality I see in everyday life is impossible to ignore and it bothers me.

The contrast is everywhere. It’s in the most basic things, like garbage bags that are flimsy and tear too easily, and in expensive, branded clothes that don't hold up after a few washes. We have supermarkets like D-Mart and Reliance, but they are nowhere near the quality or selection of a Walmart - a store considered to be for the poor in the West - let alone a Target or Dillons.

The difference is more frustrating with major purchases. Take cars, for example. The vehicles sold as premium here, with luxury car-level GST, are actually quite affordable in the US. And even then, they still can't match the quality of their American counterparts in the same segment.  Electronics, such as TV or its accessories don't last long. 

In summary, you may buy premium products in India, but you won't get the quality of the standard product in the West.

I think this an issue of planned obsolescence, where things are simply not built to last. I know companies have different manufacturing standards for various markets. We often joke that Chinese products don't last, but I've heard that's because they produce low-quality goods specifically for certain markets, while making high-quality products for the West. I've also heard people suggest that brands sell their lower-tier or ""rejected"" products from West in India, which is a frustrating thought.

This makes me wonder: Why no startups focus on such a gap in the market? This is a huge opportunity for anyone with capital. ",1252,257,2025-08-03,HuntingNumbers,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1mgez1p/why_is_there_such_a_massive_quality_difference_in/
india,year,Why Are Some Right-Wing Indians Celebrating Israel’s Attacks on Iran Despite Clear Racism Toward Indians?,"I’ve been watching the online reactions to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, and what’s baffling is how enthusiastically some right-wing Indians are cheering for Israel. It’s almost bizarre how emotionally invested they seem in a country that has very openly discriminated against Indians both at the state level and among the general public.

Let’s be honest:
1. Indians have been called “dirty” or “unwelcome” by segments of Israeli society.

2. Many Indian workers, particularly caregivers and construction laborers, have faced blatant racism and abuse.


3. There are well-documented cases of Indian Jews in Israel facing casteism-like treatment or being seen as “less Jewish” than European Jews.

Yet here we are; watching keyboard warriors from India call Israel “our brother,” “a strong nation,” and even wishing India would “learn from Israel” when it comes to foreign policy or military action. Why? Because Iran is seen as a Muslim-majority enemy, and in their black-and-white worldview, that’s enough reason to side with Israel?

It’s strange how easily they ignore how Israelis often don’t even want us there; except maybe as cheap labor or expendable manpower. They overlook the fact that supporting Israel blindly just because it opposes certain Muslim nations doesn’t make geopolitical sense. It just shows how deeply communalism and performative nationalism have hijacked their thinking.

What exactly do these people get out of it?
Is it just a desperate need to feel aligned with a “powerful ally”? Or is it simply another outlet for their Islamophobia, even if it means cosigning a state that would turn them away at the airport?

It’s one thing to understand geopolitical alliances based on interest, but this blind emotional support, especially from people who will never be accepted by those they admire, is honestly just sad and embarrassing.",876,554,2025-06-18,tychoofficial,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1lecpyw/why_are_some_rightwing_indians_celebrating/
india,year,Amazon India has introduced a ₹5 “Marketplace Fee” per order.,"Even on Prime. Even for low-value items. What exactly are we paying for?

* This isn’t packaging.
* It’s not shipping.

Sellers already pay logistics fees, storage fees, return penalties, ad costs. Now the buyer is being taxed too, just for placing an order? Isn't it a breach of contract for sellers or buyers already enrolled in Prime? Or can we do nothing but to look for replacements? What actual good replacements are out there because Flipkart is just an evil twin of Amazon already!

It’s not about ₹5. It’s about how decisions like these made quietly, affect sellers’ margins, customer trust, and platform loyalty. Swiggy and Zomato started with Rs 2, moved up to 10. Then the government got greedy and wanted tax on it as well. So we now stand at 11.8 Platform fee for both Swiggy and Zomato. Flipkart has all sorts of fees, platform fee, open box fee, shagun ka lifafa for delivery person and whatnot nonsense!

**Is this a signal to move back to the local shops? Or is it just a sign and consequence of maturing market forces?**

EDIT: As suggested by Mods, here's the proof from Amazon FAQ: [https://www.amazon.in/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=TF3RSudjie3qn1Q5y9](https://www.amazon.in/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=TF3RSudjie3qn1Q5y9)

PS: If this is not common knowledge yet, Amazon is also charging a flat Rs 49 discount fee now. So if you buy an item worth 10k, get 10% discount on your SBI card on sales, but then return the item because its not as expected, the discount fee will still have to be paid. 

PPS: I know this is a corporate strategy. Amazon is well within its rights to first sideline the local shop competition by providing discounts, and then establish a monopoly. It is natural and expected. The point of this post is that we, as consumers, must also counter strategize, right? Actions must have reactions. A duopoly is in Amazon's benefit, not ours. Least we can do is make a point against irrational practices. For example, Zepto applies so many hidden charges that there is a thin line between placing an order and getting scammed. Most e-commerce platforms seem to be moving that way. If Amazon needs more money,  increase the price of Prime by 100 bucks, I think hardly anyone will notice. But this practice of some surcharge here some there is, atleast for me, in bad taste. This is designed to entrap unsuspecting customers, not to charge genuine value.

india,year,Hindi isn't the local language of the place I live.,"

I am from Thamizh/Tamil Nadu and I can speak தமிழ், English and know some Japanese. I'm going to talk something. 🙂

# Can't learn Hindi, but happily learn other foreign languages?

I am learning Japanese, coz I have interest the language and consume Japanese resources/media and like to explore their culture. I haven't learnt Hindi, because it doesn't serves any purpose to me. The necessity or interest is not there for me. I don't consume Hindi resources or planning to stay/work in the hindi-belt.

# People are willing to have English as a link language/2nd language and would have all their kids get enrolled in English medium schools, but can't learn Hindi?

English is different. It is **FAR MORE BENEFICIAL** than Hindi and I have never seen an English native come to Tamil Nadu and mocked me for not knowing English but I have seen many Hindi speakers (even literates) mocking other state people for not knowing Hindi and calling it national language when it ISN'T. The arrogance shown by Hindi speakers in a Non-Hindi State is enough of a reason to reject a 3rd Mandatory language policy that indirectly imposes Hindi.

# Some Hindi Speakers are ignorant
How can you assume that everyone understands Hindi and make posts in Hindi in non-hindi specific subreddits like r/india (subs with more Indians) and r/Doraemon, r/shinchan (the last two were global subs for your knowledge.)

# Hindi overshadows and always had advantages/spotlights

There is a lot, but here is one of them: The union government exams (like UPSC CSE) have questions only in Hindi and English. Any Hindi speaker who can't understand English is benefitted by this. That's so nice of the government, but what about Non-Hindi Speakers who aren't good at English? Forgot about them?

# **Central Government is biased as hell!**

_An RTI application filed by The New Indian Express has revealed the disparity in fund allocation by the union government for the promotion of classical Indian languages. While the **union government released a grant of Rs 1,074 crore for the promotion of Sanskrit from 2017-2022**, as per an RTI reply sent by the Central Sanskrit University (CSU) in New Delhi, other classical languages such as Tamil, Telugu and Kannada have been getting significantly lower allocations. In response to unstarred questions by five MPs, the Ministry of Culture in 2020 stated that only **Rs 22.94 crore was allocated for Tamil** while Telugu and Kannada received Rs 3 crore each during 2017-20._

The funds alloted for language development shows how much the Central Govt. cares for other CLASSICAL and REGIONAL languages. 🤨

Don't come justifying the Hindi Imposition. I'll learn the language I wish to. One foreign language, which is lingua franca of world is enough.


P.S. Some scraped texts from this post:
The recent language issue is driving me crazy, like why you people are so forceful in imposing a language on a state that doesn't speak the language or don't have interest in a 3rd Mandatory Language? The state is already doing well with its Two-language Policy.

india,year,I come from a vegetarian family. Vegetarianism is nothing but a tool to segregate society.,"I come from an upper-caste Hindu North Indian family. No one in my extended family consumes meat products. The aversion to meat is so strong in my parents that they would ask me to switch the channel if they came across a show that involved cooking food with meat in it. They also avoid going to restaurants that have non-vegetarian items on their menu. To Indians from other regions, this might seem too extreme, but among our relatives, community, social network and workplace, such an attitude is considered perfectly normal. My grandfather used to say something along the lines of - *consumption of meat makes demons rejoice*. You might think this has to do with a strong sense of morality, I believed so as well. But it's their attitude towards people who do consume meat that makes it clear that vegetarianism has nothing to do with ethics or love for animals.

Vegetarians will consume dairy with abandon, they have to, in order to make up for the lack of protein in their diet. But no one wonders what becomes of dairy animals. A cow is, after all, raped repeatedly through artificial insemination and made to produce milk all its life. When it finally stops gestating, it's sent to a slaughterhouse to be turned into leather or let loose on the road to feed on trash and die as roadkill. No matter how much upper caste Hindus claim to love cows, they'll not approach the corpse of one. Even a cow owner won't deal with the corpse because it's considered the exclusive domain of lower caste Hindus. Vegetarians (since they are predominantly upper caste Hindus) are perfectly willing to support a political party whose explicit agenda is to target and persecute minorities, whose leader is popular precisely because of the slaughter of Indians he oversaw. Somehow not consuming chicken or goats is considered a loftier ideal than empathy for fellow human beings. How can anyone be okay with lynching humans to save animals?

It's because vegetarianism has nothing to do with morality, but with *purity*. You have my guarantee that when lab produced meat is introduced on a large scale, vegetarians will still choose to avoid even though there is no cruelty involved. There's also something called pure vegetarianism which excludes eggs. An egg is nothing more than the period of a hen that is unfertilized. It will never result in a chick hatching from it, but it is excluded from a pure vegetarian diet because it is considered impure. This is why an Indian vegetarian is perfectly fine consuming animal products like milk, butter and ghee, or wearing silk saris that involve boiling silkworms alive. Since these products are considered to be pure, it does not reflect badly on you to consume them. By extension, those who consume meat are considered impure, dirty, and unclean. These people are unworthy of consideration or respect, and more importantly association in society. Vegetarianism signals to others in society that you belong to the same social strata as them. A meat eater on the other hand is to be avoided, pushed as much as possible to the margins to live in slums and ghettos.

Think about it. My family, and vegetarians like them, claim to be disgusted by meat. How is it in any way normal to find what 70% of Indians, and the vast majority of humanity, consume to be revolting? Their problem is not with the food, it's with the people, because they associate meat with being lower caste. It's the horror of doing something that will degrade their status that makes them avoid meat at all costs. This is why there is segregated seating in cafeterias in universities, government offices and in private companies, it's so that vegetarians don't get inconvenienced by the presence of meat eaters around them.  You know where else similar segregation happens? In government schools in the hinterlands, where dalit or tribal children are made to sit at the back, or when a mid-day meal cook gets kicked out because upper caste students won't consume food made by her. Why do people rent apartments only to people who are vegetarian like themselves? It's because our homes, our food and our weddings are the key markers of our status. The intrusion of lower castes in any of these three spaces either by renting our houses, eating food with us or marrying us will lead to a loss in societal status.

Why does a illogical term like **non-vegetarian** exist solely in India? A so-called non-vegetarian does consume vegetables and fruits, and a vegetarian consumes animal products like dairy. Yet, 30% of the Indian population has managed to define the normal diet of people throughout the world as the outlier. 90% of humans on this planet are defined by the fact that they are *not vegetarians.* ",975,277,2025-08-20,Separate_Rise2723,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1mvj1mb/i_come_from_a_vegetarian_family_vegetarianism_is/
india,year,Why in the world is Sanskrit still being taught in schools?,"I don't mean to offend anyone, but I just don't understand a purpose for continuing to teach Sanskrit. No one speaks Sanskrit any more. It's basically an extinct language at this point. 

I understand that Sanskrit is historically and culturally significant, but teaching it as a mandatory subject is just unnecessary when kids could be learning languages that they can actually use in daily life. 

Hours and hours are wasted on Sanskrit, when the teachers themselves can't speak it fluently. Even if they could, what of it? What purpose does it serve? The vast majority of children just slog through the textbooks to pass their board exams and then never think of Sanskrit ever again. 

I learned Sanskrit for 5 years, but I can't remember a single Sanskrit word. Most of Sanskrit taught in schools focuses on rote memorization instead of on actually developing a deep understanding of the language. Children just memorise Sanskrit question-answers like a script, so what's the point? 

Why continue to force this mostly dead language on kids who are already stressed enough as it is? Like, what is the practical purpose? I don't see the language making a comeback ever again. Sanskrit had its time. It's mostly dead now. Why continue to beat a dead horse? 

Edit: People are mass downvoting and acting like I have a personal grudge against Sanskrit. Guys, I'm not against Sanskrit or our cultural heritage. I'm all for us learning about our history and traditions, but the way Sanskrit is being taught in schools now, IT IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS. All it's doing is adding to students' burden. Continuing to teach Sanskrit in this manner is not going to revive the language. Sanskrit teachers don't know shit about the language they're teaching. Most Sanskrit teachers only have surface level knowledge of the subject. This is just added stress serving no real purpose. Either remove it, or reform the way it's being taught. Or, you could make it an optional subject instead. Not sure why people think I'm hating India by expressing this opinion. 

Edit2: Haha, people have resorted to name calling and insulting my intelligence for the comment I made that I don't remember any Sanskrit. Very nice, everyone. 

Did you not read anything I wrote? I've already said the focus is more on rote learning, and guess what people forget things learned that way. You can actually express an opinion without resorting to name calling and insults like animals. You won't change anyone's mind by insulting them. You all are coming at me like a pack of rabid dogs. 

Someone name calls and I just lose all respect for them and stop trusting their judgement. What is it about this topic that's making you so angry you're sending me vile DMs? I'm just some rando.

india,year,I genuninely think Arrange Marriges's are BAD for India as a Whole.,"Arrange marriages  
\[typical Indian phenomenon where elders dictate or hold the deciding vote on life partners\]  
are certainly not ideal.  
The idea of marrying a complete stranger itself gives me chills.

This practice also promotes negative things like dowry, caste restrictions, and limitation of choice.

Men & Women would be more empowered, and instead of locking themselves into unhealthy or coerced marriages, they would have the freedom to make better choices for their own lives, instead of succumbing to parents’ pressure.

Also, without the system of arranged marriages, the average Indian man & women would have to genuinely work on character, career,  behavior if they wished to find a partner.   
That effort would naturally push man to improve and become a better human being & learn to accept women as an equal human. (Which we Indian men especially need to.)

But with arranged marriages, even a man of poor values or bad conduct can still end up with an innocent partner, simply because families arrange it. The same problem exists in reverse as well.

thats why I genuinely think arranged marriages are BAD for India as a whole.  
  
Also, the feudal concept of arranged marriage as a bond between two families, not merely two individuals, is just a weightless argument and an old/medieval concept from a time when individuals had no life of their own.",644,305,2025-09-17,Vinayakmh19,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1njbfwz/i_genuninely_think_arrange_marrigess_are_bad_for/
india,year,"SBI employee leaked my private banking info to my cousin — and now it’s spiraled into threats, money laundering, and arrests.","A few months ago, I posted a story about my chacha (uncle). https://www.reddit.com/r/india/s/8JpFTJWqmV 

He kept pestering me to invest in his son’s trading. I knew it was a money pit, but to shut him up and keep family peace, I gave him ₹1L. Chalked it off as a loss for my sanity.

Three months later, they came back demanding ₹5L more. I said no, of course. Then came the guilt trips, ""Bhai hoke help kar de"", emotional blackmail, passive-aggressive taunts, the works. I had a massive fallout with them and thought that was the end of it.

Days later, I find my bank statement and account details posted publicly on Twitter in a rant post like “Indian relatives are snakes.” And yes, my actual account number, transaction history, everything. Not just leaked, screenshotted from SBI’s internal CBS system, complete with branch ID and employee login credentials visible.

Turns out, since I paid the ₹1L by cheque, my cousin had my account number. He somehow convinced an SBI employee to pull up my private banking data, just to check if I was “lying” about not having money. I completely lost it.

I tagged SBI publicly on Twitter, sent a legal notice to the bank, filed a cybercrime complaint and a FIR as well. Within 48 hours, police traced the IP back to my cousin, and he got arrested.

Meanwhile, the SBI employee began blowing up my phone, crying, begging me to withdraw the complaint. He’s in his late 50s, close to retirement, apparently manipulated by my cousin into thinking I’d scammed them. His family was in bad shape, wife terminally ill, daughter unmarried and I verified those claims.

He even shared WhatsApp chats and call logs showing how my cousin and uncle lied to him. I recognized the pattern, the same emotional pressure tactics they once used on me, they used on this man too.

I revised my complaint to drop the demand for immediate termination. Meanwhile, my cousin got his karma delivered hot his elder brother (a genuinely good guy) flew in from Bangalore, slapped him in front of the whole mohalla and police station. Relatives are cutting ties. They returned the ₹1L with interest (which I refused).

The SBI employee even offered to cover my legal expenses, though a lawyer friend did it for a bottle of Chivas Regal. I Thought It Was Over. It Wasn’t.

Just when I thought I could breathe again, I began receiving threat calls from international virtual numbers ""Give ₹5L or we’ll leak more.""
Then my bank account started seeing suspicious credits and debits, large sums entering and leaving without my involvement. Classic money laundering pattern.

I immediately froze the account, filed another complaint, and raised absolute hell with SBI. It took every method, sam, dam, dand, ved to get them to act seriously.
Today, I received the CBS access logs from SBI’s internal audit. These names popped up as those who accessed my account without authorization:

Dipak Kumar Upadhyay – SBI Lalsot, Dausa (Rajasthan)

Piyush Chauhan – SBI Chajlet, UP

Vinod Kumar Meena – SBI Mandawari, Rajasthan

Now I will make sure they are blacklisted from banking sector. Let this be a warning, stay the hell away from these branches. Clearly, data protection is a joke for them.

It’s your right to vote for politicians, so by your own excuses, you should not have been granted the rights in the first place. Why are we women so irresponsible when it comes to politics, why don’t we care, why don’t we get involved? I have had to fall out with all my childhood friends because they don’t wanna grow.
As a young Indian woman, I am tired of justifying myself, my ideologies and having a conversation with other women and in general the lack of awareness. 
Edit: 
1. Most of the comments here are very positive which is very affirmative. I expected a reaction where most people would bash the f outta me, but it isn’t that way. 
2. Some people feel that being ignorant is a blessing, so why don't we give up our voting rights? Bec it doesn’t matter, right? And don't crib and cry about how unsafe India is for women or about basic living necessities. Because you don't care enough about it to be even aware of it. 🤷🏻‍♀️
3. I feel sorry for all the freedom fighters who fought to get independence and even died, got assaulted, women got raped, saw famine to a generation who doesn’t care to even be aware.

india,year,JEE has ruined engineering in India,"jee has ruined engineering in india. it has killed creativity and turned the whole thing into a rat race where the only skill that matters is mugging up formulas and solving the same pattern of problems. i’m a software engineer and it makes me sick watching kids who started coding at 12 or 13 and had so much potential just lose it all once they get sucked into the jee grinder. they stop building projects, stop experimenting & stop being curious because none of that matters in jee.

the result is obvious. no indian college is anywhere near the top in qs rankings. not a single indian university shows up in the top 50 of icpc, the most important competition for competitive programmers worldwide. years of coaching and hype and the “best minds” of india cannot even break into the top bracket globally.

jee is a psyop to keep the middle class middle class. it eats away years of their youth, drains their parents’ savings and then spits them out into overcrowded colleges with mediocre teaching. and don't get me started on how btech professors themselves don't know how new frameworks & new technologies work, most continue this outdated chalk and talk method, recycling the same 20 year old notes, teaching students c and java like it’s still 2005 while the real industry has already moved on. they’ve never built a real project, never shipped code, never touched the tools companies actually use, but they’ll grade you on theory exams and make you feel like you’re not good enough. it’s a joke.

the coaching mafia has made billions selling this dream. kota is basically a factory farm where kids are treated like products. they don’t care if you burn out or die, as long as the fees keep rolling in and they can plaster a few toppers on billboards.

this is what happens when you worship an exam instead of actual learning. jee has turned engineering into a factory that produces unskilled degree holders not engineers.

india,year,"India Based Startup Cancels 22 LPA Offer Over Hate Speech, Then Faces Mass Reporting, Fake Reviews, and Online Backlash","A few days back, I had put up a post on LinkedIn stating that Jobbie has cancelled the offer letter of 22 LPA extended to a candidate because of derogatory comments they had posted on LinkedIn against certain religious communities.

The post got crazy viral and was captured by publishers across the country and what followed after that something we expected but not of this magnitude.

The post had one single motive:  
To make social media free of abuse directed at any community, and to remind those who spread such hatred that their actions have consequences.

But the keyboard warriors proved the point in real time. They flooded the comments with the very same hate the post was condemning. When they saw that we remained unfazed and unshaken, they resorted to mass-reporting the account until the verified profile was taken down.

It didn't stop there

There’s a saying: *When you can’t destroy someone’s work, you try to destroy their reputation.*

* The website was brought down for 12–15 hours.
* Fake reviews poured in on Google, dragging our rating from 4.8 to 3.4
* Some of our employees were harassed about why they work for a Muslim founder (We have since asked them to remove affiliation with us from their LinkedIn profiles).
* A few media houses published the news with a religious angle designed to incite hate.

I never mentioned any community’s name in my post. People simply judged that I am Muslim, assumed the other person must be Hindu, and concluded I took away someone’s offer based on religion.

The irony is that the very account trying to bring communal harmony on LinkedIn was taken down for so-called ‘communal violations’ by the same platform.

A Voice Raised... A Voice Silenced.

It has been 11 days, and still the account is restricted on the platform, even after verifying the identity again.

Common sense comes pretty uncommon these days!!

india,year,We Have Some of the Worst People in the World,"Indians have a bad reputation. Everywhere. I’ve been to multiple countries and I’ve seen people sigh or have their smiles disappear in a few moments after I’m asked where I’m from. I can totally see why, and it’s just unfair.

Whenever I leave the country and come back, the very second I reach my gate for the last connection that takes me to India - I’m just smacked with all the reasons why we’re hated around the world. 

Phone - full volume. Talking - full volume. Queue for the boarding - you got stinky retards breathing literally right against your neck, I mean wtf is that shit? Barging in to the queues, pushing and tugging… fuck all of those who do this. Just embarrassing.

Flight lands - it’s a competition to see who gets off the flight first even though everybody has to wait for about the same duration at baggage collection or immigration. I haven’t even officially entered the country yet ffs. 

There’s almost always a completely pointless argument with the staff during boarding or inside the flight. Because they don’t have a fucking clue what the rules are. Read it. If you didn’t, at least the balls the face the consequences when you have to. It happens to me too, but I don’t ruin somebody else’s day for it. Learn the lesson and move on. Don’t be a piece of shit.

I love my home but I fucking can’t stand these habits. If this only happens rarely, I wouldn’t be complaining. But this happens Every. Single. Time.

And obviously these experiences are just from airports and flights, the list only grows longer when you enter. Newer generations on average seem to have much better social awareness but still compared to other countries… it’s just pathetic. I’m not saying I’m perfect but dammit I try my absolute best to never cause any discomfort to anyone. 

Sorry about the rant. I’m just very frustrated that I have to endure an awful amount of shit just to visit my favourite place in the world. My home. Please help make it a better experience for all of us!

india,year,Whoever says that India is better than developed countries where you have to do everything yourself is basically supporting labor exploitation in India?,"Hear my rant,

My sister runs a salon business and hires beauticians every 6 months. Recently, she was interviewing a girl aged 28 who works with a big brand salon. She informed her that she works from 10 am to 8 pm on 10,000 rs per month and has been given targets to bring business worth 50,000 rs every month by selling products/services to clients.

I feel sad that labor laws are so bad in developing countries like India that humans are not even treated like humans. I wonder even in tier-2 cities what a person with 10k salary can do about his/her future. I know you can say that 10k is way more than what a rag picker earns and all that. My point is - this person or many people like her are giving 10 hours of every day with no bonuses on Diwali but still have no future and the reason is - There is no minimum wage concept that is followed by businessmen. There is no gov body who audits and makes sure that people in unorganized business are paid well.

I was talking to my client in Netherlands and he informed me that even a plumber charges 150$ for an hour in their country. Even if blue collar jobs are paid well and yes its true that no ones wants their kids to be blue collar worker but those who don't have the luxury to afford an engineering/doctor education still have minimum wage concept in place to support their families.

Here in India, poor hard-working people are exploited by those who are in power. And that includes middle/upper middle class people like us.

india,year,"Kantara - twisting a local culture, and fitting into a mainstream narrative","I’m from Mangalore, and I believe anyone should have the right to tell stories and make movies — no matter the content. That freedom is important.

But with Kantara, there’s something that really hurts those of us from Tulunadu. The movie twists the very core of our cultural beliefs. The traditions here pre-date the Vedic systems. They’re primal and deeply rooted. The Bhoothas aren’t deities they’re spirits. They’ve always been seen as equals among humans, a part of nature, a presence we live in harmony with.

The annual Bhootha Kola isn’t about worshipping a god sent from elsewhere. It’s a community ritual and people from every religion come together to honour that ancient spirit world.

Rishab Shetty by his own admission, learnt about all this mostly from watching YouTube videos (Anupama Chopra interview). Then he decided to weave in a completely different narrative (box office effects)bringing in Lord Shiva, turning these local spirits into messengers of a Hindu god, and recasting Bermer, our faceless, nameless supreme presence, as a superhero-like figure, almost a chosen one.

For the uninitiated, this version on screen can start to feel like historical fact. And that breaks the hearts of many here.

All I’m asking is: see Kantara for what it is a decent action heavy pulp fiction. A story, not history.

Imagine if someone rewrote the Ramayana and made Rama and Sita sail to Bali instead of Lanka or claimed Krishna was a Greek god who happened to land in India. It wouldn’t sit right with most people.

That’s exactly what has happened here. So enjoy the movie as a piece of fiction, but don’t mistake it for the truth of Tulunadu’s culture.

Today she told me I am worthless and I should just die

I have tried everything to make her happy but she always finds the slightest imperfections and scolds for that
The other day I did the majority of dishes and she scolded me for not doing the cooker and shifting the dal to pot, I didn't do it as I didn't find it necessary as dal was warm

For the last 8 months she has been pressuring me to do jobs we are middle class family (if I am part of it) and my dad shop is not doing great due to the economy of India 

I point out 100 of such incidents where she is mentally harassing me, my younger sister and my dad

india,year,Went to Bali. Came back with PTSD from Indian civic sense,"I have always been a firm believer that India is a treasure trove for travel. From mountains to beaches, deserts to rainforests, we have it all; history, culture, diversity. I’ve always judged people who rushed to explore other countries while ignoring the beauty that exists in our own. I thought, why not explore all of India first before going abroad? That was, until I took my first international trip to Bali recently.

It was a bit of an eye-opener.

Bali is very similar to India in many ways. The culture, the landscape, even the chaos of scooters and tourists. But what stood out to me was how much more enjoyable the experience was. The main reason wasn’t geography or infrastructure, but civic sense.

I sat on random benches, ate food at beach shacks, walked around freely and all without worrying about hygiene, litter, or uncomfortable stares. No pan masala stains on the pavements, no chip packets flying around, no continuous honking on the roads. It genuinely broke my heart a little.

Even the roads, while not luxurious or perfect but were clean. In India, walking on footpaths feels like a game of hopscotch, avoiding paan stains and random puddles of who-knows-what. You’re constantly watching your step instead of enjoying your surroundings.

And it’s not like Bali is some super rich country but the people seem to respect public spaces, and that makes all the difference.

Even more disappointing! I saw Indian tourists in Bali throwing garbage in the sea when there was a dustbin barely 2 meters away. Cutting queues while boarding ferries. Being loud and disrespectful. It hit me that these are the same things I’ve been tolerating in India for years, thinking it’s just how things are.

But why is it like this?
Why do we honk at red lights as if it makes them turn green faster?
Why do we spit on roads and throw trash outside our car windows?
Why does basic decency take a backseat, even among the so-called “educated” and well-off?

Honestly, it’s getting harder for me to enjoy even a weekend outing in my city now. The irritation begins long before I reach the destination. The honking, the aggression, the filth, the general lack of respect for public space and each other. It chips away at my peace of mind.

I used to think the next generation would be better, but seeing my own colleagues who are very well paid, educated people, litter without a second thought makes me wonder if this will ever change. I do call it out, but they shrug it off like it’s no big deal.

I love India. I want to stay here and see it get better. But it hurts to admit that sometimes, it feels like we don’t deserve the beautiful country we have.

Would love to hear your thoughts. Have you felt something similar either after traveling abroad or just in your day-to-day life here?

**TL;DR:**
Went to Bali, realized how much civic sense matters. India is beautiful. We just don’t treat it that way.",1200,177,2025-06-02,Educational_Bell9809,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1l1lwlo/went_to_bali_came_back_with_ptsd_from_indian/
india,year,Racism in my own city!,"I'm still shaken after an encounter with a Shoppers Stop employee in Delhi NCR. I went to the Shoppers Stop store to buy a bag during the sale, and while I was browsing, a group of customer executives were staring at me. One of them made a comment to his colleague, loud enough for me to hear: ""2 momos ki plate lagane ko bol do"" (tell them to serve 2 plates of momos). I was taken aback and confronted him, saying ""I heard what you said."" My mom was with me, and when I told her what happened, she was furious.

The worst part is that this isn't an isolated incident. I've faced racism my whole life, from school to college to my office. But it's especially hurtful when it comes from an unexpected place where you believe that people are educated and respectful. Delhi NCR is where I was born and raised, and I never thought I'd face such blatant racism here.

I'm fed up with the mentality of my country. No matter how good you treat them, they seem to always be the same. Has anyone else faced similar experiences? How do you deal with it?

PS: I'm not looking for sympathy, but I want to raise awareness about the racism people from the Northeast face in India.

Edit: Thank you all for your responses and for understanding that what happened was not okay.

Just to give more context — when I confronted him and told my mom what he said, she was furious. Her exact words were: “Aise logo ko ek chaata maarna chahiye.” (Such people deserve a slap) I told him directly, “Bhaiya, aap bahut badtameez ho. This is not fair.” I even called him out in front of 2–3 of his colleagues, but sadly, no one stepped in or said anything to him.

At that moment, the only thing I could think of was to get out of that store. My mom was very adamant about reporting him or taking some action, but I told her we had already created a scene, and since no one supported us there, I didn’t think anything would come of it. So, we let it go.

After coming back home, the one thought that kept in me was — how can someone say something so blatantly racist in front of so many people, and everyone acts like it's normal? That’s why I wanted to speak up here — to get it off my chest and to make people aware.

And yes, while some of you suggested reporting him or slamming the store online — that’s something I don’t plan to do. Because of one person's behavior, I don’t want other employees, who had nothing to do with it, to suffer the consequences of a formal complaint or public backlash.

So again, I just want to say — if you ever find yourself in such a situation, don’t freeze like I did. If you feel like you can take a stand, please do it. For yourself, and for anyone else who might not be able to.

——-

UPDATE 1: Hey everyone! I have a pretty cool update to share.
After all the support and the voices raised here, one of the Shoppers Stop employees actually reached out to me personally and apologized — which I honestly found really sweet. He also informed his team and escalated the issue to upper management.

Soon after, I was contacted by Shoppers Stop’s official Reddit account, and once I shared the full details, I got a call from their head office. They apologized multiple times for what happened — it was honestly overwhelming, but in a good way.

What really surprised me was that they insisted on visiting my home to personally apologize to my mom too. Since there’s renovation going on at my place, I told them I’d prefer to come to the store and meet them there instead — especially the guy who made the comment.

I’ve been informed that he’s been given a final warning for his behavior. I really hope he understands the seriousness of it and learns from this.

Will keep you all posted with a final update after I visit the store — should be this Friday or Saturday. Thank you again for all the support. It truly made a difference 💛

——-

FINAL UPDATE: Hey everyone! Just wanted to share the final update on this incident. I visited the store today with my sister — the store manager was present and sincerely apologised. They also gave me a Ferrero Rocher Moments box and a bouquet, which was a really kind gesture. Their Zonal HR also personally apologised.

As I had mentioned earlier, the individual who made the inappropriate comment has been officially warned, so I didn’t get to see him. But again, I want to make it clear — this was never about Shoppers Stop as a brand, but about one person's behavior.

Lastly, I truly appreciate all the love, support, and kind words I received here. It reminded me that there are good people around us and kindness hasn’t vanished.

Thank you once again to everyone who supported me and to the Shoppers Stop team for taking the matter seriously and addressing it properly.

india,year,"Radhika Yadav Didn’t Die, She Was Executed by Patriarchy","I still can’t shake the image of Radhika Yadav’s bright smile, coach, mentor, rising tennis star, cut down by her own father’s twisted sense of “honor.” She wasn’t just any young woman, she built her academy from scratch, trained kids, pulled her family out of debt, and showed up every day with the kind of fierce dedication that should’ve made her a jewel in India’s sporting crown. Instead, her choice to stand beside a Muslim co-star in a music video became the only thing some vultures could see.

Let’s call it what it is, a sickening cocktail of patriarchy, misogyny, Hindutva terror and Islamophobia. The same trolls who celebrate Radhika’s murder would’ve lionized her if she’d bowed her head, shut her mouth and stayed inside her place. But she filmed Karwaan with a Muslim artist, an act of basic artistic expression and human solidarity, and that, to the right-wing outrage machine, was an act of provocation. Suddenly her very existence was a crime.

These keyboard bigots aren’t arguing “taste” or “tradition”, they’re weaponizing fear. They gaslight us into believing that a woman’s friendships or professional collaborations with Muslim men are betrayals of some mythical Hindu soul. They erase her years as a tennis coach, her academy’s success, her role saving her family from financial ruin, and reduce her legacy to a celluloid frame with a brown guy. It’s Islamophobia masquerading as “protecting our culture.”

And don’t kid yourself, women who complain about “encoding our children” with tolerance are often the same trad-wives preaching bleach creams and submission. They’ll virtue-signal at Navratri, then turn around and slut-shame Radhika for daring to appear confident on screen. Internalized misogyny is as lethal as any mob with saffron flags. It’s the same rot that tells daughters to silence themselves in class because their voices are disruptive.

We’ve seen this playbook before, honor killings applauded by villagers, political cadres rewriting textbooks to scrub out Muslim heroes, teachers jailed for “anti-national” lectures, activists dubbed “urban Naxals” because they questioned the caste-ist status quo. Now a daughter is dead, and the corpse is still being slandered online. It’s enough to make you want to scream.

But here’s the truth they don’t want you to feel, solidarity is our only weapon. I’m a doctor, one of the lucky few who trained in India’s finest institutions, born into privilege, and living in a city (Hyderabad) where we celebrate friendships and relationships across faith wih joy and pride. I’m a Hindu who knows that Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, socialism, feminism, and sexual freedom are not threats, they are the lifeblood of a just, inclusive, and humane society. And if you can’t handle that, you’re the problem, not us.

Radhika’s murder should’ve been the moment we all paused and asked why a loving daughter, coach, and entrepreneur was treated as a sacrificial offering to male entitlement. Instead, the same cowards who cheered on the demolition of mosques and the lynching of Muslims are now approving her blood. They can keep their hashtags, they’ll never drown out the truth that freedom, peace, and interfaith friendship aren’t crimes.

So here’s my plea, don’t buy their lies. Don’t let their fear-mongering steal your compassion. Every time you see a woman walk confidently in a deep-neck dress, behind the wheel, or on a tennis court, remember Radhika. Remember that her real crime was daring to be independent, talented, and kind to everyone, regardless of faith. And let’s make sure her death isn’t just another footnote in India’s long list of “acceptable” atrocities. Let’s honor her life by refusing to be silenced, by teaching our daughters that they can stand tall, even when the world demands they bow.",1620,109,2025-07-12,Zurati,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1lxy40p/radhika_yadav_didnt_die_she_was_executed_by/
india,year,Met an IND senior couple at Ist airport yesterday,"Pki here. Yesterday, while returning to Pk from a European country, I had a transit in Istnbl, and a senior lady from IND approached me, looking totally confused as to where to go. For context, Istnbl airport is really big and you usually need to check your gate and walk a long way to it. For first timers, it can be a challenge, even for educated ppl. What makes it worse is, Turk officials do not even respond, they are so racist. When it was my first time, I approached a Turk official at the same airport and they were not willing to help me understand where to go. I've also been to germany and people and airport officials are so helpful there.

Anyways, She had a sindoor on her forehead and was with her husband. Asked me where I was going, I told her I am going to KHI, Pk. They were kind of taken aback by that response, perhaps because they thought I am from their country.

OMG, both of them were extremely simple. She was like ""Beta tu hum ko gate tak pohcha dega na?"" I assured them yes, why not (They were kind of suspicious whether a Pki would help them).

I was very polite to them, looked up their gate and escorted them to their gate (a very long walk). They thanked me and we parted ways.

The point being, the ordinary ppl on both sides are so simple and peace-loving, we don't need wars. We are so similar. We spoke a similar language and were the only ones who could help each other at the airport when no one else wanted to. It could have been the other way round: A confused old Pki couple unsure of where to go and a young person from India helped them. Don't get me wrong here, it doesn't mean the two-nation theory doesn't hold true, but we don't need wars.

Thanks, Adani. Remember when privatizing airports was supposed to make things better? LOL. Now, the winner isn’t the company that runs airports well, it’s the one that promises to squeeze the most money out of YOU, the passenger.  

Here’s all the bullshit you’re paying for:  
UDF – Because you should pay for the airport’s existence, obviously.  
ADF – Because UDF wasn’t enough robbery.  
GST – Because taxing a tax is innovation. 
Security Charge – Paying to get harassed at security.  
Convenience Fee – The convenience of getting scammed.  
Fuel Surcharge – Because global oil prices are your problem.  
Walking Tax – Okay, not official, but might as well be, since you pay for walking through a metal detector.

Meanwhile, in Reality Tourism? Dead. Who wants to visit India when half your trip cost is just taxes? Jobs? Lol. But hey, at least we’re busy fighting over Mughals instead of jobs. Happiness Index? We’re below Afghanistan. But sure, let’s keep arguing about temples and mosques.  
Inflation?  Every time you buy something, you’re doing mental math on how much the govt is stealing from you.  

Babur isn’t charging you UDF. Aurangzeb isn’t slapping GST on your chai. The real villain is today’s government, inventing new ways to suck money out of you while giving nothing in return, no jobs, no healthcare, just more taxes.  

We really need to ask why is flying so damn expensive? Where are the jobs? The hospitals Why are airports sold to whoever can scam passengers the most?

He had taken work from home today because his mom had a chemo session. It was her third cycle, day one. These sessions usually go on for three days since the hospital is closed on Sunday, so they go on Friday, Saturday and Monday.

He and his brother have been handling everything on their own since they lost their dad in 2019. The hospital is in Parla and they stay in Malad, and anyone who has driven that Western Express Highway stretch during rush hours knows how draining it gets.

They booked an Uber because driving themselves after long hospital hours can be exhausting. The morning ride went fine, but while returning, the driver with plate number MH.04.LE.0725 accepted the ride, they got in, shared the OTP, and then suddenly said, “Sir ride cancel karni padegi, Ola Uber ka strike chal raha hai.”

There was no strike. They had taken another Uber that morning and saw plenty of cabs on the road. When my teammate showed him the fare, which was around 316 rupees, the driver said he would not go for that price and asked them to get down.

His mom was quiet, tired and weak from the chemo treatment, and still had to stand on the roadside because this driver decided he was not getting enough money.

He didn’t even argue. I think in that moment he just wanted to take her home without adding to her stress. He reached out to Uber support but all he got was the usual “we will look into it” and nothing else.

What made me angrier is that something similar has happened to me before. A driver once tried the same “strike chal raha hai” excuse mid-ride. I raised it to Uber and got it sorted after pushing for it, but I can imagine he didn’t have the energy to fight because of what his mom was going through.

It just breaks your heart how insensitive people can be. If you cannot take the ride for that price, then don’t accept it. But don’t make someone stand on the road like that after a day at the hospital.

india,year,Why can't women exist in peace at night????,"Okay, I’m literally shaking and crying in frustration and disgust. I don't even know if this is the right sub, but I need to vent or I’m going to throw something.

I’m 19F, recently done with my engineering entrance exams and finally breathing after what felt like a lifetime. Tonight, I just wanted a normal dinner hoodie on, messy bun, sneakers, zero makeup, just some peace and dosa with an old friend (guy, school buddy, not that it should matter).

We were at this dosa joint around 10:30 PM, light rain, the city felt quiet and kind for once, until it didn’t.

Three guys showed up. Drunk, loud, and already staring. I tried to ignore them at first, but the comments started. Nothing clever, just the usual grossness. One of them muttered loud enough “Rich girls like her are always looking for attention.”

It was like a switch flipped.

I told them to back off firm, not dramatic. They laughed. One of them tugged at my hoodie string like it was some kind of joke. That moment I’ve never felt rage like that in public before. The disrespect, the entitlement, the sheer shamelessness.

I stood up, plate still in hand, heart pounding. They didn’t stop until I pulled out my phone and said I was calling the cops. Of course, they ran.

The cops showed up late, asked me questions that made me feel more judged than protected. My grandparents told me to ""let it go"" and not go out so late again.

But why?

Why is it my timing, my outfit, my tone, my decision to eat outside that’s questioned, not their behavior?

I’m so tired. Not scared, just tired. Of having to be alert all the time. Of having to manage male egos in public. Of not being able to do something as basic as grab food at night without some man making me feel unsafe in my own city.

I’m filing a report tomorrow. I’m not letting this slide.

india,year,Why is religion being shoved down on us at every front ?,"Why is it that religion is shoved down on us at every front be it politics or movies or cartoons.
Why are we so obsessed with religion ?
Right from cartoons to movies, religious things are everywhere.

On cartoon channels you can see that there are cartoons for different deities. Ganesha, Krishna, Hanuman etc.

In india there have been several movies based around religion and god and there's no end to it honestly. Make no mistake i'm curious about the upcoming Ramayana starring Ranbir Kapoor but that's only because Hans Zimmer will be creating the background score for it. 

We've already made too many Ramayan themed movies and this is just another one of those.

If we come to politics then for several years Ram Mandir was literally in the election manifesto of the current Ruling Party. Religion is part of our politics.

When it comes to Ramayan and Mahabharat, we have really confused mythology with history.

During festivals, God and religion somehow become excuse for masses to create a ruckus example Ganpati Visarjan, Kanwar Yatra etc.

During saavan there was this case of certain someone shutting down KFC outlet in Ghaziabad and wanted all delivery apps to stop delivering non veg food. This was an Aggressive attempt to shove down beliefs and practices on others.

During school I remember that ramayan and Mahabharat were supplementary text books for Hindi subject in 6th and 7th class and this was CBSE textbook. I read those books with utmost interest at that time but now I don't think I really needed it.

There's no effort to encourage critical thinking in our life but yeah everyone is ready to shove down religion on you given a chance.",490,232,2025-09-12,captainrushingin,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1net30q/why_is_religion_being_shoved_down_on_us_at_every/
india,year,Why is such strong Anti gay sentiment so prevalent in India?,"
I’m 22 years old, and I’m gay. That’s not something I chose or something I can change, but it feels like every day, society reminds me that just being myself is a problem. Lately, it’s been worse. Everywhere I look on social media, in comment sections, it’s filled with hate. People make fun of LGBTQ folks, calling us names, questioning our existence, saying things that make me feel small, even though I know I shouldn’t.

What’s heartbreaking is that this hatred isn’t just random people online. It’s society at large. It’s the government. The same people who are supposed to stand for equality and rights are the ones denying me something as basic as the right to marry. I see the news, the debates, and it’s all so clear; they don’t think people like me deserve the same happiness as everyone else.

And then there’s the fear. Every time I step out or think of opening up about who I am, I hesitate. Indian society feels so hostile. People judge, gossip, and sometimes even hurt others for being different. 

It’s tiring. I didn’t ask for this fight, but here I am, trying to exist in a world that doesn’t make space for me. I can’t change who I am. I just wish I didn’t have to live in fear, constantly defending my right to love and live as I am.

india,year,Why I donated lakhs of rupees to random strangers?,"I've received a lot of DMs after helping a random stranger by [donating](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1h47jas/comment/lzx5ot9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) a few lakh rupees towards his father’s kidney surgery. Rather than responding to each one individually, I figured I’d make a post to explain why I did it. 

A few years ago, I did something similar—covering the entire [donation](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b7c76y/help_my_mother_for_cancer_treatment/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) amount to help another stranger with his mother’s breast cancer treatment. 

Why these seemingly random acts of kindness? It’s not like I get tax benefits (being a U.S. citizen), nor do I seek fame (though it wouldn’t be hard to figure out who I am). The story goes back more than a decade. I was working at a startup, writing code in a high-rise building with an incredible view of Silicon Valley. It must have been around 3 p.m. when I got a call from my father. It was an unusual time for him to call, so I answered, panicked.""Are you busy?"" he asked.""No, Papa, tell me,"" I replied.I could sense something was terribly wrong. He couldn’t speak and broke down in tears. I didn’t know what to say.

“Papa... Papa…” That’s all I could manage. Then I heard my mother in the background: “Give me the phone, I will talk.”

My mom cries easily, but that day, she spoke calmly. She told me she had noticed a lump in her breast and that the biopsy confirmed early-stage breast cancer.

I took a deep breath. “Hmm… it’s okay, I’m coming home.”

I don’t remember much of the next 1–2 days. What I do recall is driving on US-101 on my way home, unusually aware of the speed limits. It was a survival instinct—I needed to make it home safely. You become acutely aware of life when confronted with death (yours or a loved one).

Once home, instead of immediately booking the earliest flight to India, I started searching for the best oncology hospitals. I realized finding the right doctor was more important. Fortunately, I got in touch with Dr. Kanchan Kaur at Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon. (She’s not just an incredible doctor, but also a kind and compassionate person). I flew to Delhi within 2–3 days of that call.

Over the next couple of months, my mother underwent surgery and chemotherapy. She is doing well now.

So, what does all this have to do with my donations?

The Medanta logo.

I spent a lot of time in Medanta Hospital, handling administrative tasks and paying bills. It wasn’t hard to notice the number of poor families seeking treatment at this expensive hospital—sleeping outside on sidewalks, sharing a single meal, doing whatever they could to care for their loved ones. Although my primary focus was ensuring my mother received the best treatment, I couldn’t ignore what I saw. Their struggle resonated deeply—not just intellectually, but on an experiential level. Now, anytime I see the Medanta logo, something stirs inside me. It’s hard to put into words, but I feel it deeply. If you check the Milaap fundraising post, you’ll see the Medanta logo. That’s what did the trick for me.

Today, I’m not a billionaire (in USD). But I have been fortunate enough to have founded a successful startup a few years ago. I plan to invest and grow the proceeds from my startup’s exit, and when I die, I want to donate most of it to charity. I haven’t worked out the details yet.

Moving forward, I’ve decided to shift from making one-time donations to individual strangers and instead focus on something with a broader impact. I envision creating a charity that promotes a healthier lifestyle and encourages early detection of treatable diseases. I haven’t finalized the plan, but that’s the direction I’m headed in. 

Before I end, I have one request:

Breast cancer is one of the most treatable cancers. Early detection is the key to managing it. If you have women in your family over the age of 45 (or have family history of breast cancer- it is highly genetic in nature ), please encourage them to get a mammogram.

A diagnostic test doesn’t change whether someone has cancer—but it does change how prepared you are to fight it.

india,year,Anyone else feel like Indians abroad just rebuild the same social pressures they ran from?,"The irony is, a lot of Indians leave India saying they want freedom, better opportunities, or to escape the exhausting social mindset. But once they settle abroad, they recreate the same small circles, the same gossip, the same judgments — just in a different continent.

Many Indians leave because they want better opportunities, more freedom, or to escape the social pressure. But after they move abroad, they immediately try to find other Indians and create the same kind of groups they wanted to leave behind. Same gossip, same judgments, same attitudes — just in a different country.

And it’s not just about being Indian. These people even divide themselves by language and state — Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi, Malayali, etc. The same old friction, competition, and mindset continues, just like in India. New country, same drama.

By “Indian mindset,” I mean the constant need to compare careers, salaries, marriage plans, and interfere in other people’s lives under the excuse of “care” or “community.” It’s the endless gossip, unsolicited advice, and this obsession with controlling how others live.

I stay away from all of this. I don’t go to these gatherings or cultural events divided by state, language, and religion, and I definitely don’t try to “bring India to the West.” I know that no matter what, I’ll always be seen as a second-class citizen by the natives, but at least I don’t have to deal with people stuck in that Indian mindset every day.

Sometimes I think people forget why they left India in the first place. After some time abroad, when they feel lonely, they start missing India and looking for other Indians. Then they complain that Western people are “cold” or “don’t talk to neighbors,” as if interfering in everyone’s life is somehow better.

These same people complain about how hard it is to fit in, but they make no effort to understand the language, culture, or people where they live. They just build a mini-India and then wonder why they still feel like outsiders.

What starts as simple nostalgia quickly turns into this weird idea of “we are better, we have culture, they don’t.” Meanwhile, they sit in their small groups gossiping about others, just like back home.

The truth is, they wanted freedom but can’t handle privacy. Western people mind their own business because that’s normal here. Not every stranger wants to be your friend, neighbor, or marriage prospect. That’s not cold, it’s called boundaries.

By “boundaries,” I mean the Western habit of respecting privacy — not asking personal questions, not interfering in decisions, and not treating neighbors like extended family unless invited.

And of course, many of these people live double lives. In front of other Indians, they pretend to protect “values.” Behind closed doors, they do whatever they want. Classic hypocrisy, just in a different country.

I’ve thought about why this happens and honestly, I think a lot of people just aren’t mentally ready to adapt to a new culture. They want the benefits of living abroad — better money, healthcare, infrastructure — but they still want the comfort and familiarity of the same social dynamics. It’s like people want India 2.0, not a genuinely new life.

What they don’t realize is, in the West, people value privacy, independence, and respecting boundaries. Not everyone cares where you work, how much you earn, when you’re getting married, or whether you have kids. But somehow Indians abroad still keep trying to live under the same rules and expect others to play along.

For me, moving abroad wasn’t just about changing location, it was about changing mindset. I wanted peace, privacy, and to live how I want — not another desi neighborhood committee deciding what’s “right” for me.

Curious if anyone else here feels the same. Have you experienced this? Do you avoid these circles too, or have you found any that are actually chill and not just India in disguise?

⸻

TL;DR:
Indians leave India to escape the mindset, but abroad they recreate the same judgmental, gossip-filled circles divided by language and state. They complain about Western people minding their own business while refusing to adapt themselves. I moved abroad to escape this, not to rebuild it or be part of it somewhere else.",920,131,2025-07-19,The_Prodigal_Son_666,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1m47ygy/anyone_else_feel_like_indians_abroad_just_rebuild/
india,year,Feel absolutely dejected and disgusted #VoteChori,"Today, I’m absolutely done. I knew things were bad behind the scenes and I always knew there was fraud and corruption going on but I genuinely (perhaps naively) believed that at least our voting system, the very foundation of our democracy was not compromised. 

Everyone needs to take this seriously, just running away isn’t good enough. We have such a beautiful country, so much variety and such a rich culture. How could we have let this happen? Hate politics and this demonic party has been a cancer upon our once beautiful country. Yeah, it was definitely not perfect. But I was alive for 2 decades of Congress rule and this is something different. 

I remember being young and watching comedians at 8 pm on prime time TV making fun of Sonia Gandhi and MMS whilst dressed up as them. No ED raids, no institutional bullying. I remember after 26/11 when there were resignations. At least some accountability. Where is the now? How many terrorist attacks have happened on their watch and who has resigned? 

I don’t remember r**ists being garlanded, I don’t remember this level of hatred among citizens, I don’t remember hatred being peddled openly and brazenly just for votes. It’s horrible, the air has gotten worse, the roads are terrible, the infrastructure is crumbling. Bridges are collapsing and people die. No accountability. Forests and mangroves are being destroyed, the air will only get worse. 

Our neighbours used to be our friends. The foreign policy that I myself used to praise a few years ago has been an abject failure. Now each of our neighbours is straying away from us, into China’s hands. We’re isolated in our own backyard. When 26/11 happened, Obama met MMS, condemned Pakistan, publicly stated that they need to stop housing terrorists. When Pahalgam happened what did the US president say? “Oh India and Pakistan that was a bad one, both our good friends were looking into it” and boom Pakistan got an 8bn dollar loan from the IMF (US has the heaviest vote there).  Our foreign policy is a joke. 

People rejoice over our 4tn+ dollar economy. “We’ve crossed Japan to become the 4th largest economy” they say. What are we getting from that? Who benefits? How do people live in Japan and how do we live here? What’s the per capita? And don’t tell me about population. China has similar population and 7x the per capita. Enough excuses. We have a class of oligarchs who control the government‘s decision in significant ways. Enriching themselves and keeping us poor. Company Raj never left. 

For me this was the final straw. No I don’t want to leave and run away. I love India. I’m a patriot. I can’t stand what has become of our country. Sorry I had to rant. I love all of you who read until here ❤️ whether you agree with me or not.

india,year,Should Men Stop Looking at Cleavage?,"As an Indian woman, 30, married, and living in Hyderabad, I love dressing up. But it’s made me think a lot about how society sees women’s bodies—our clothes, and yes, cleavage. It’s not just a superficial issue; it reflects deeper, often troubling, attitudes.

My friend Ananya, a corporate lawyer, had an experience that really brought this home. She was on the metro wearing a V-neck kurta—stylish and perfectly appropriate. A man in her compartment stared at her chest the entire ride. She felt so uncomfortable, constantly adjusting her dupatta, even moving seats. The staring didn’t stop. She was furious, but afterward, she also questioned her outfit. Should she have worn something less revealing?

That self-doubt is something so many women experience. We’re conditioned to blame ourselves for other people’s behavior. Why should we have to police our bodies to avoid the male gaze?

**“It’s Instinct”: A Weak Excuse**

You often hear men (and it is usually men) say they can’t help but look. “It’s biology,” they claim. I remember a colleague at the hospital, Ravi, justifying his wandering eyes with, “Men are visual creatures. It’s science!” But we’re not just driven by primal urges. We have self-control.

Sure, cleavage can be eye-catching—society has sexualized women’s bodies for centuries. But a decent person knows the difference between a quick glance and a prolonged, uncomfortable stare.

**Why Do Women Wear Revealing Clothes?**

Let’s be honest: why do we wear clothes that show cleavage? Is it always about seeking attention or seducing men? Those assumptions are rooted in outdated, patriarchal thinking.

I dress for myself. Sometimes it’s about feeling confident and comfortable. Sometimes, in Hyderabad’s heat, it’s about practicality! I wear everything from sarees and kurtas to tank tops and dresses. It’s about freedom of choice.

And yes, sometimes it’s nice to get a compliment. There's a difference between a respectful glance and being objectified. Staring to the point of making someone uncomfortable? That’s the problem.

**The Hypocrisy We Live With**

Indian men often criticize women’s clothing while happily ogling Bollywood actresses in revealing outfits on screen. A colleague once asked, “Why wear revealing clothes if you don’t want attention?” I countered, “Why do you wear sleeveless gym tees? Don’t you want attention too?”

It’s infuriating. Women are expected to be both modest and attractive, traditional and modern—catering to male expectations. But when a woman asserts her independence, through her clothes or anything else, she’s judged.

We’re constantly objectified. From scooter ads to fairness cream commercials, women’s bodies are used to sell everything. Even educational institutions use images of smiling women on their posters.

This objectification seeps into everyday life. If a woman shows skin, it’s often assumed she’s “asking for it.” That’s simply not true. My clothing choices are not an invitation to be leered at or touched.

**“It’s Natural”: So What?**

It’s true, men might instinctively notice. But instincts don’t excuse inappropriate behavior. We all have impulses we need to control. You don’t punch your boss when you’re angry, do you? A man can glance and then look away.

The problem is the idea that a man has a right to stare because “she’s showing it.” She’s not “showing it” for anyone. She’s wearing what she wants, and that deserves respect.

**Feminism Isn’t About Hating Men**

Feminism is often misunderstood. Some men think it’s about erasing gender differences or demonizing men. It’s about equality and respect.

It’s important to distinguish between a fleeting glance and something like catcalling or assault. Most women won’t be bothered by a quick look, but a prolonged stare is definitely a problem.

And women, it’s okay to speak up. Saying “Excuse me, stop staring” isn’t aggressive; it’s assertive.

**The Taboo of Attraction**

Here’s something we rarely talk about: both men and women enjoy attention. There’s nothing wrong with that. The problem comes with disrespect.

In India, where anything sexual is taboo, these interactions are even more complicated. A man staring feels like an invasion. A woman dressing boldly is seen as rebellious.

Why can’t we normalize women wearing what they like and men respecting that?

**My Point**

Should men stop looking at cleavage? It’s natural to notice. But staring, ogling, or making someone uncomfortable is wrong. A woman’s body isn’t public property. Her clothes aren’t an invitation.

We need to move beyond these outdated ideas. Women shouldn’t have to dress “modestly” to feel safe. Men need to learn to control their gaze. Let’s stop blaming women and start holding men accountable.

What do you think? How do we create a society where women feel free to dress as they please without fear? How can men and women coexist with mutual respect?",557,445,2024-12-25,Zurati,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1hm4jgs/should_men_stop_looking_at_cleavage/

Last year I paid more than 200K in taxes and when I look back at the return of investment for that I see the news of rapes, terrorism, murders, hate crimes and what not.

Our country is so much divided on all social structures that people have stopped ""thinking"" and behave like hive minded zombies.

When I see these posts of crimes I see more people defending it by saying it's lesser than so and so countries so we should shut the fuck up and let it be the way it is! Or if we are criticising something we should leave to Pakistan!

Dude, if I were paying Pakistani taxes i would have not complained. If you are taking my money and giving me absolute dogshit in terms of services, I will speak up.

Recently during war there was a sentiment about support for army and i totally respect them and support them because they protect our countries from outside threat. But what about inside threat?

The inside threat is literally the people of our country. Gurugram, Chandigarh, Bengaluru, Mumbai everywhere people with inflated egos committing literal murders and these are just reported cases. Rural India is worse. 

There is no safety because there's no unbiased and strict implementation of laws. Tomorrow if I'm riding a bike and I'm late for my office and if I cut a Thar on my way, i might end up losing my life and worse part is the perpetrators won't face any consequences.

They ended up calling a taxi for me, but what annoys me the most is that first driver with who I spent 6hours, he didn't give a sh*t about making me lose my time, eventually losing the night I previously booked etc. It just make me rethink about the entire humanity.

I'll report him badly to Uber and hopefully he is losing his right to drive on that app.

And my point is, I would not tell my mom, my sister or my friends to come here, it's just so much scams going on and many people have bad intentions towards you.

india,year,English woman (27F) traveling solo in India - what is your advice?,"My work will require me to travel to India in November for a month-long assignment. I have always been fascinated by India. It is the country on top of my bucket list. I would like to take a  few months off from work after my assignment is over to travel through India.

Since I am there for work, this will have to be a solo trip.  If everything turns out according to plan, I will be looking to travel from mid-December to mid-March. My base will be in Mumbai or Pune. I definitely want to visit the Taj Mahal, but other than that I do not have any fixed itinerary in mind.

About me, I am a single, neuro-divergent, academic woman. Due to my neurological set up I have trouble reading emotions and sensory overload (especially loud noises) exhausts me. I need to rest in a quiet, dark place to get my energy back. On the other hand, I can eat all kinds of food and I can comfortably sleep in sleeping bag in a tent. I don't need AC because I don't get too cold or too hot very easily. I am trained in self-defense.

I'm not looking for the basic ""Is it safe?"" advice. I can get that from google. Here I'm seeking the kind of nuanced insights that only someone who has lived or traveled solo in India can offer. Especially looking for advice from women.

Safety & Logistics:

* Beyond the ""dress conservatively"" advice, are there specific regional differences in what is considered appropriate attire?
* How to best manage unwanted attention without causing offense? I'm used to a firm ""no,"" but I understand the cultural context might require a different approach. Any specific phrases or non-verbal cues that are effective?
* How do you handle tuk-tuks and taxis, especially late at night? Is Uber truly reliable and safe everywhere? Are there specific precautions I should take?
* I want to experience a train journey in India. Is it safe for a solo woman? I am prepared to take time out just for train travel.
* What's the best way to handle money? Should I rely on cash, or are credit cards widely accepted, especially in smaller towns? What are the safest ways to carry and access cash?

Cultural Immersion & Authentic Experiences:

* Are there SAFE not-on-tourist-radar destinations that I should consider visiting? I am partial to hills and forests. I don't care much for beaches.
* How can I genuinely connect with locals, especially women\*\*?\*\* I want to have authentic conversations and maybe even share a meal. Are there specific places or activities where this is more likely to happen respectfully?
* What are some of the most common cultural misunderstandings or social cues that might trip up a Westerner, even a seasoned traveler? I'm talking about the subtle stuff you only learn from experience.
* Are there specific ethical tourism initiatives or female-run businesses you'd recommend supporting? I want to make sure my trip has a positive impact.

I welcome advice from everyone--especially from women with solo traveling experience.",171,376,2025-09-03,AriadneDauphin,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1n7hzri/english_woman_27f_traveling_solo_in_india_what_is/
india,year,I just hope India doesn’t forget what truly made us strong — our diversity.,"I know I’m not alone in feeling this, but I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately.

India was never perfect — but the one thing we always had was our diversity. So many languages, faiths, cultures, yet somehow stitched together. And honestly? That’s what made us beautiful. That’s what made us India.

But recently, when I hear things like removing “secular” and “socialist” from the Constitution, or pushing a one-religion narrative... I get scared. Not just as someone who cares about people, but someone who doesn’t want us to go down the same path as countries like Pakistan, Iran, or Afghanistan.

They tried to build nations only around religion. What happened? The exact opposite of progress. Civil unrest. Brain drain. Suppression of rights. Look at their economic state today.

Compare that with Singapore — a diverse, strict secular country that rose to insane levels of development because it embraced harmony and didn’t politicize religion. Or the US, where freedom of religion is enshrined (despite its flaws). Countries that protected diversity moved forward. The ones that didn’t... well, you can see where they are now.

I'm just a normal 20-year-old trying to make something out of myself. But I want to live in an India that values inclusion — where people don’t feel like they have to “belong” to a specific group to have rights or dignity. Where being Indian is enough.

Our Constitution — thanks to people like Ambedkar — knew the dangers of majoritarianism. And they protected us from it. Let’s not throw it all away just because of politics.

Maybe I’m overthinking. But I really, really don’t want India to become another cautionary tale in history books.",413,240,2025-07-06,EntertainmentGold613,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1lsztfq/i_just_hope_india_doesnt_forget_what_truly_made/
india,year,Living as a woman in India feels like living in hell sometimes,"Every single day I question what kind of society we’ve created here.

I walk barely 800m to my workplace. I wear formals a shirt and pants and still, men stare, tease, pass comments, sometimes even touch inappropriately. You’d think clothing would make a difference, but it doesn’t. Predators don’t care.

What breaks me more is how normalized all of this is. Openly sexist, disgusting comments under every feminist reel… rape jokes thrown around like they’re casual… men who treat women as objects walking around freely like it’s nothing. And society? Silent. Families hush it up. People say “ignore it.” But how do you ignore the fact that even basic dignity and safety are stolen from you?

It’s terrifying to realize that rape is so normalized in this country. It’s brushed off, downplayed, joked about, politicized. For women here, it’s not just about “fear of the dark” it’s fear all the time, on the streets, at work, in buses, in colleges.

I’m angry. I’m exhausted. And I don’t want to accept this as “just how things are.”

I am not anti national but I just want to leave this country so bad . Women are not objects.
No government, no court , no jurisdiction has ever bought a change for women. 
Why are rapist walking free without any shame?

How do you even survive in a place where harassment and assault are treated as everyday inconveniences instead of the crimes they are?

india,year,Make Believe in Bharat: Tariff King Piyush Goyal Gaslights India and the World,"In remarks reported by Shruti Srivastava for Bloomberg, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal claims that India's tariffs on U.S. goods are modest -- averaging just 7-8% -- because the steepest duties falls on products India doesn't import.

It's a technically precise, strategically misleading assertion. It's also a classic case of official antinomy: the deliberate disjunction between rhetorical liberalism and operational illiberalism that defines much of Indian policymaking. Goyal's performance continues to remain more about narrative management rather than maintaining transparency -- weaponising averages to obfuscate intent.

New Delhi likes to posture as a willing participant in global trade, while its tariff regime actively suppresses integration, insulating domestic inefficiencies under the guise of ""sovereignty"". In this context, the policy contradictions aren't incidental, they form the governing logic.

The core of Goyal's claim rests on circular reasoning: India does not import certain goods, therefore high tariffs on them are immaterial. But India doesn't import these goods \_precisely because\_ the tariffs are designed to preclude that possibility. It's not the absence of demand -- it's the policy-induced exclusion.

Moreover, the quoted average tariff is statistically hollow, diluted by lines with minimal trade relevance to the U.S. -- zero-duty raw materials or intermediate goods India doesn't source from America. These low-duty items drag the average down and hide the real story: that tariffs on the goods the US actually wants to export - like whiskey, motorbikes, cars, and farm products - are still sky-high.

This is not an accidental oversight; it's a deliberate construction to protect politically protected constituencies within India (read: oligarchs, middlemen and trader cartels) that Goyal ultimately represents. India's trade rules are not shaped by the market. They're shaped by a system built to protect local industries and shut out competition. This is not a flaw -- it is the deliberate architecture of policy in New Delhi whose  reflexes stem not from economic logic, but from a deep-seated autarkic impulse to dominate and control the remaining provinces it still lords over with simmering, jealous centralism.

india,year,Indian parenting sucks,"Hi guys 
I'm just  venting out my frustration regarding indian parenting and  3 rd class indian society.
I grew up in an Indian village .
Where religion was everything, you have to follow shakahar( vegetarian )no eggs ,no meat , 
You have to read those religious books every morning, do Puja path .sanskar and all.
   Fasting 2 times a day , plus lots babas ,pravachan and all.
There were no emphasis on good quality education , parents use to give there example that 
  "" They studied in poverty and bla bla bla""
They enrolled me in some crappy goverment school.
When I was 4,5 th class , i questioned them 
Why you didn't put me up in some english medium convent school.
My father's reply ""english medium school or convent school makes you lazy and it doesn't make any difference just you have to study hard ""
Absolutely no vision no planning,
That's school was f**cked up ,it was so backward 
They didn't even teach us proper english 
Most of my english i learnt on Google .
Anyhow I completed my 10 th .
   As all my study was in my regional language and i realised by then this regional language study won't be helpful.
So I quit my studies .
Then my parents started pressuring me why I'm not earning money .  

I mean excuse me without good education and guidance they wanted me to earn money .
We had a multiple fights, arguments 
 In feat of rage i left my hometown and went goa 
Started working in the restaurant and learnt basics and started working in a bar .
 I struggled a lot , now i can earn 60 k per month in hotel industry I'm almost 39 year old .
Worked in singapore for an year  also. as a corporate mixologist and earned around 1.20 lakh per month 
Now back in india 
So my life and dreams are already messed up 

Still I'm not satisfied with life 
This was not my dream .
My dream was to become an entrepreneur, or CEO in some big IT company 
  But lack of good parenting and bad education and f*ck all environment.  
I lost that opportunity in life 
And settled for peanuts and minimum wages . 
    What you guys think of it ?
Criticisam is welcome 
Thanks .

Edit : guys please don't say money is not everything, this and that 
Money is everything for me 
I'm really sorry 
I know how it feels to be left out and ignored.

  I never got married and there is no intention of marriage.
As i don't want to show same crappy life to my children.
I would have gotten married .
If my yearly income would have been around 2 cr minimum 
So that I'll be able to give good quality education to my children.
Or most probably send them abroad to study .
As situation in India is getting worse

india,year,BJP under fire for using India-Pakistan tensions for political gain,"As tensions escalate between India and Pakistan following the launch of Operation Sindoor, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has come under sharp criticism for attempting to politicise the national security crisis through a social media campaign that many have deemed inappropriate and divisive.

On May 9, while border areas remained on edge amid a military standoff between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, the BJP released a video extolling Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s aggressive posture in dealing with cross-border terrorism. The video juxtaposed Modi’s military responses with what it portrayed as the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance’s (UPA) “meek” approach, listing terror attacks such as the 2005 Delhi blasts, the 2006 Mumbai train bombings, the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and the 2010 Pune bombing as examples of Congress’s alleged failure to act decisively.

The BJP’s post contrasted these events with Modi’s policy of not engaging in peace talks, instead carrying out precision strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. However, the timing and tone of the campaign were widely condemned, even by those sympathetic to the party.

Psephologist Yashwant Deshmukh took to X (formerly Twitter), calling the campaign “absolutely disgraceful” and warned that it undermines national unity. “Pakistani media is saying you are doing all this for your own political gains, and this kind of stupid campaign gives them legitimacy. This is not the time for political differences but a time to take everyone along,” he wrote.

Political analyst Sumanth Raman echoed the sentiment, stating, “At a time when the entire country is united they put this out. Shameful. This is NOT the time for trying to score political points.”

Journalist Rohini Singh also criticised the move, calling it “pathetic” and adding, “What makes it even more pathetic [is] that it’s being done at this time when the nation is united.”

Actor and activist Gul Panag weighed in, urging restraint and unity: “The nation today stands UNITED, across the political spectrum. After a very long time. Please don’t play petty politics at this time,” she posted.

Several commentators pointed out the factual distortions in the BJP’s video, noting that it was under the UPA government that Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving terrorist from the 2008 Mumbai attacks, was captured, tried, and executed. They questioned whether the current administration has shown similar resolve in apprehending those responsible for the Pahalgam attack.

Critics argue that the BJP’s attempt to score political points amid an active conflict not only erodes the spirit of national unity but also risks giving propaganda fodder to hostile forces. At a time when Indian Armed Forces are engaged in real-time operations, many expressed that such rhetoric as irresponsible and damaging.

In stark contrast, the Congress party has refrained from politicising the situation. On May 7, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge publicly supported the Armed Forces and lauded their action. “We are extremely proud of our Indian Armed Forces who have struck terror camps in Pakistan and PoK. We applaud their resolute resolve and courage,” he said in a statement. Emphasising unity, he added, “National Unity and solidarity is the need of the hour and the Indian National Congress stands with our Armed Forces.”",714,155,2025-05-10,opinion_discarder,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1kj8jru/bjp_under_fire_for_using_indiapakistan_tensions/

india,year,Am I forcing my parents to give me money ?,"Hi guys, I’m a 22-year-old 2025 B.Tech graduate
 
I recently got placed in a service-based company with a ₹5 LPA package. Surprisingly, the work-life balance seems pretty good—my internship and senior feedback confirmed this. But deep down, I feel I’m capable of much more.

Throughout college, I was always the “tech guy.” Even though it was a Tier 3 college, I still managed to land 3 job offers during placements. Still, I know the Tier 3 tag and Indian market competition are limiting my growth and potential.

That’s why I’ve been seriously planning to go abroad—preferably the US—for higher studies. I started preparing months ago and even told my parents about it around 3 months back.

But here’s the problem.

My younger brother is a 3-time NEET repeater. Unfortunately, even after all this time, he hasn’t been able to score well. Now my parents are considering buying him a full-payment MBBS seat, which could cost around ₹1.2 crores. They’re thinking, ""You’ve already completed one degree, let him get his now.""

But here's my take:
Becoming a doctor requires hard work, discipline, and a lot more than just wanting it. If he’s struggling this much now, what’s the plan when PG NEET comes? I genuinely feel I deserve a shot at a better future abroad, not just because I want it—but because I’ve worked for it.

I’m not even asking them to fully fund my education. I’ve clearly told them I’ll take an education loan and repay it myself after graduating. Still, they’re hesitant, saying things like “What if you don’t get a job after your MS?”

Now if I bring it up again, it feels like I’m forcing them, and that makes me feel guilty.

I’m still working hard—preparing DSA, building solid projects, and considering job switches to better roles. But in India, the competition is only increasing. Even with growth, you barely hit a good salary by 26–28, and then it's the usual: marriage pressure, family expectations, and no real “life” to enjoy.

All I want is a fair chance. I know what I’m capable of. I just want to build a future that reflects that.",401,191,2025-07-18,Asleep_Ad7319,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1m30odv/am_i_forcing_my_parents_to_give_me_money/

india,year,Where is Anna Hazare Now? A Critical Question for Modern India,"Hey Fellas, 

Anna Hazare, once the face of India's anti-corruption movement that gripped the nation from 2011-2013, has maintained a conspicuous silence during some of the most pressing challenges facing contemporary India. As the country grapples with the electoral bond scam, widespread infrastructure failures, persistent unemployment, and what critics call a ""washing machine"" phenomenon where corrupt leaders receive clean chits after joining the BJP, many Indians are asking: where is the man who once brought the government to its knees with his hunger strikes?

Anna Hazare's Current Status: A Fading Voice

From his village Ralegan Siddhi in Maharashtra, the 87-year-old activist has largely retreated from national politics. His recent public appearances have been sporadic and often critical of his former protégé Arvind Kejriwal rather than addressing systemic corruption. In February 2025, following AAP's electoral defeat in Delhi, Hazare blamed Kejriwal for getting ""tangled in liquor and money,"" suggesting his image was ""dented"" due to involvement in the excise policy controversy.

The last significant movement Hazare attempted was regarding farmers' issues, where he threatened his ""last protest"" in January 2021 but eventually canceled it after meeting with BJP leaders. This retreat from activism has drawn criticism from various quarters, with Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut questioning Hazare's silence on major corruption allegations against the Modi government since 2014.

The Electoral Bond Scam: India's Biggest Corruption Scandal

While Hazare remains largely silent, India faces what many experts call the biggest corruption scandal in its independent history. The electoral bond scheme, declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, has revealed a systematic pattern of quid pro quo arrangements. Companies facing Enforcement Directorate raids purchased electoral bonds worth millions, with the investigations subsequently stalling or being closed.

According to data analysis, the BJP received over ₹8,500 crore through this opaque funding mechanism. Opposition leaders describe it as an ""extortion scheme"" where businesses were coerced into making donations to avoid regulatory action. The scheme operated like a ""legalized corruption"" system, where companies paid political parties and received favorable treatment in return.

The ""Washing Machine"" Phenomenon

Perhaps most troubling is the systematic pattern of corruption cases being shelved when opposition leaders join the BJP. An Indian Express investigation revealed that since 2014, 25 prominent politicians facing corruption charges crossed over to the BJP, with 23 receiving reprieve in their cases. Three cases were completely closed, while 20 others remain stalled or in cold storage.

This includes high-profile leaders like:
- Ajit Pawar (NCP) - received clean chit after joining BJP alliance
- Praful Patel (NCP) - CBI filed closure report in Air India scam case after joining BJP 
- Ashok Chavan (Congress) - proceedings stayed in Adarsh Housing case after joining BJP

The Congress party has theatrically demonstrated this ""washing machine"" effect, showing how corruption allegations get ""washed clean"" when leaders join the BJP.

Infrastructure Crisis: Roads to Rivers, Bridges to Debris

India's infrastructure tells a devastating story that demands Anna Hazare's attention. In 2025 alone, the country witnessed multiple failures, like roads turning into rivers after minimal rainfall and flyovers collapsing prematurely. These issues highlight a class ecosystem where poor planning and corruption lead to repeated public hardships. (THIS REMIND ME OF KHATTA MEETHA).

Revisiting the Origins: Was Hazare's Movement a Planned Opposition Move?

Looking back, Hazare's first major protest in 2011 the hunger strike at Jantar Mantar demanding the Jan Lokpal Bill sparked a nationwide anti-corruption wave against the then-Congress-led government. But was this a genuine grassroots effort, or something more orchestrated? Some allegations suggest it might have been backed by opposition forces, like the RSS, to undermine Congress. For instance, RSS leaders were spotted on stage early on, and slogans like ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"" raised eyebrows. Prashant Bhushan, a key figure in the movement, later claimed RSS involvement, which reportedly created unease in minority communities.

Did the opposition ""send"" Hazare for his anshan to ruin Congress? Or was it truly non-partisan, as Hazare claimed, focusing on systemic corruption regardless of party? Hazare has criticized both Congress and BJP over the years, but the timing and impact on the UPA government make me wonder.

What do you all think, fellow Indians? Where is Anna Hazare now amid these scams, inflation, unemployment, and infrastructure woes? Was his original movement manipulated by opposition parties to target Congress? Share your thoughts, experiences, or any insights, let's discuss legitimately and keep it civil.

india,year,"Men (Gen Z and Gen Alpha), please do not hold hatred for women; it will destroy only YOU","This long letter is for young Indian men and boys - teenage guys, Gen Alphas/ younger Gen Z's. I'm a millennial man and I am writing this for you.

**As you know, people use social media to validate their bias; you CAN find nuance, if you care.**

There is a gender war on Reddit, X, Instagram, and all over social media, really, after Atul's tragic suicide. You guys are young, impressionable, and open-minded. Please do not allow yourselves to be turned into haters of girls, provoked into being abusive, threatening girls in DMs, or painting feminism as the enemy.

You think a conservative, traditional girl, egged on by her brother or father, may not file false rape or domestic violence cases? Laws will be misused by evil women of all political ideologies until our justice system gets its act together. You cannot change the law or enforce it, so what can you do? You can organize peacefully or start a movement for an accountable justice system without hating on women.

Get into friendships or romantic relationships with loving, kind girls, irrespective of their ideology, if you already aren’t. Surround yourself with empathetic, wise guy friends who have healthy relationships with women and are not women-haters.

If you already hate girls or feel disillusioned by them, please take a step back. Stop seeking their validation for your life experiences through hostile arguments. Please do not expect them to agree with you. They may have totally different lived realities and experiences and may not relate to your worldview. You should not be in the business of ""converting"" them to your faith.

**Nobody is a saint just because they belong to a gender or subscribe to an ideology.**

Half the women who identify as feminists and choose to have kids will deliver baby boys. These kids will be raised with a worldview inculcating values that the mother believes in. Will such an upbringing make them immune to false cases of rape or domestic violence as adults?

In fact, it could be a conservative, traditional wife who decides to file a domestic violence case against him, or it could be a feminist acquaintance who files a false rape case against him. It is possible that both of them may be egged on by men in their family. Misuse of law and perpetration of abuse are not limited to a political ideology or gender.

The very same Gen Z feminists whom you may badly wish to hate today will likely see the world through your perspective as well when they become mothers of young guys your age in two decades, or when they witness injustice towards young guys in their workplace, as corporate leaders.

**Gen Z girl feminists will evolve. Or maybe not.**

Some of the Gen Z girl feminists will also end up losing loved ones in their lives—a guy friend, a brother, or a son—to an evil woman's actions. Please don't be in the business of invalidating a woman's lived experiences, no matter how right you may think you are. There are no absolute truths, theories, or ideologies in politics. Listen to their experiences, but share yours only if you think they care.

Decades later, some Gen Z girl feminists, wronged by injustice against their young sons, subordinates, colleagues, or friends, may also start to actively campaign for the need for gender-neutral laws and for improving the mental health of young guys. Don't be surprised when young Gen Beta girl feminists of 2045 denounce the views of the then-older Gen Z feminists as regressive or as internalized misogyny.

You must remember that navigating life and shaping a worldview from their experiences is their journey to take, and not for young guys like you to influence through your arguments with them. There is quite a bit of cognitive dissonance, even among otherwise sane people in India this week, because in Atul's case, the judge and the apparent abuser are both women, while the victim is a man. It will be difficult for some to accept that two women egged him on toward suicide.

**Your guy friends who harbor hatred for women will evolve too. Or maybe not.**

Half the guys, including some of your guy friends who wrongly believe that a woman's life in India is easy, will father girl children. Raising their young daughters, some of these men will realize that India is indeed an unsafe place for women and that there is a great burden on women at the workplace, regarding marriage, and via social expectations.

When you have a daughter, you will also be scared as you read about hundreds of rape cases in India every single day, girl victims struggling for justice, and even to exist. Slowly but surely, some of these men with young daughters will start to empathize with feminists and become angry and agitated, repeatedly flagging women's issues.

It will not take 25 years because the threat starts the moment a girl child is born. Many of your guy friends will come around to appreciating why women feel so strongly about men being abusive. Unfortunately, by then, the fashionable young Gen Beta guys will denounce your friends—the older Gen Alpha men—and their views as men who cope. There will be a new gender war, and you will be helpless.

**Polarizing ideologies and divisive people are here to stay. You must learn to keep yourself sane.**

And then there will be a new Andrew Tate. There will be a new Donald Trump. There will be a Taylor Swift. There will be another wave of feminist movements, but there will also be misogyny and misandry. A whole new set of people and ideologies will turn decent human beings against each other, full of suspicion and hatred. Some old ideologies will be repackaged in a new bottle. There will also be abusers of all kinds, irrespective of gender.

In the race to the bottom that awaits us, please keep an open mind by helping other guy friends when they are in trouble. Learn and unlearn every day. Challenge and question your beliefs every day while keeping an open mind. If you think your teenage guy friend is turning into a girl hater or has trouble in his relationship, introduce him to your girl buddies who are kind and warm.

**Kindness and empathy elude the vast majority of us. They are necessary skills, all the more for men.**

Bottom line? People evolve while ideologies remain rigid. Personal experiences trump all social media theories. If you have a good life and healthy friendships with women, show guys who are depressed, angry, or frustrated that good people exist. Help them if they are struggling mentally. Show them that the world can be a lovely place. Please give them positivity and hope. It will most likely change their lives in a good way. If you think you can constructively help make the justice system better, do it in the real world, not by threatening women online for a two-minute power trip or to relieve your angst.

Some of the things Atul wrote in his letter are very disturbing, particularly his views on women. While you advocate for justice for Atul, please do not subscribe to hatred toward women. Was he driven to such an extent by his wife's toxic behavior? Is that what turned him into a woman hater? We don't know yet. In the end, the loss was only his and that of the people who loved him. May he rest in peace.

Please don't be consumed by hate, for it will destroy ONLY you.",843,179,2024-12-13,kuttoos_enn_vilicho,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1hd9wsv/men_gen_z_and_gen_alpha_please_do_not_hold_hatred/

Can you give me some advice?,"I do not have brothers or sisters or parents, I'm divorced with no children and have no relationship with my in-laws and also have no nieces and nephews, but I do have some extended family. I live between Chennai and Mumbai.

  
I want to have a Will made where I want pretty much whatever I have will go to various charities. I am in my mid-50s and am in generally good health, and I find it important to make a will at the earliest so that if anything was to suddenly happen to me, my Will should state who gets what I have. The last thing I would want is for extended family or anyone else to fight over my belongings if I didn't make a will.

  
Here is where I could benefit from advice from you guys :-



I want to choose charities that are close to my heart, and they may not necessarily be very well-known ones. Such as charities that focus on: under-privileged children; those who are mentally challenged; those who are physically challenged; charities involved in looking after the aged (old-age homes?). Things like these. 



I would prefer to look at charities that require funding, rather than large charities who are well-funded.

  
What is the best way to get to know about such charities? And how would I know if they are credible institutions?



One big consideration I have is, how will I know these charities will be functioning at the time my Will comes into effect? (i.e when I die).

  
What suggestions or advice can you give?

india,year,"For Modi Government, A Muslim Is Tolerable Only If They Fit Into It's Propaganda","Yesterday, based on a complaint by a local BJP leader for a social media post, Haryana Police arrested Dr Ali Khan Mahmudabad, a professor of political science at Ashoka University. Dr Mahmudabad has been charged with endangering India's sovereignty, outraging religious feelings, assertions prejudicial to national integration, promoting disharmony and hatred, among other charges.

Another FIR lodged by Haryana Women's Commission accused Dr Mahmudabad of disparagement of women officers, incitement of communal unrest, violation of women’s modesty, among more charges.

One cannot properly comprehend the absurdity of these complaints without reading the text on the basis of which Dr Mahmudabad has been arrested.

> 8 May 2025

> Strategically India has actually begun a new phase in terms of collapsing distinction between military and terrorist (non-state actors) in Pakistan. In effect, the response to any terrorist activity will invite a conventional response and so this puts the onus on the Pakistani military to make sure that it cannot hide any longer behind terrorists and non-state actors.

> In any case the Pakistan military has used militarised non-state actors to destabilise the region for far too long while also claiming to be victims on the international stage. It has also used the same actors – some of whom were targeted in the recent strikes – to foment sectarian tension in Pakistan. 

> Operation Sindoor resets all received notions of Indo-Pak relationships as the response to terrorist attacks will be met with a military response and removes any semantic distinction between the two. 

> Despite this collapse, care has been taken by the Indian armed forces to not target military or civilian installations or infrastructure so that there is no unnecessary escalation. The message is clear: if you don’t deal with your terrorism problem then we will! The loss of civilian life is tragic on both sides and is the main reason why war should be avoided.

> There are those who are mindlessly advocating for a war but they have never seen one, let alone lived in or visited a conflict zone. Being part of a mock civil defence drill does not make you a solider and neither will you ever know the pain of someone who suffers losses because of conflict.

> War is brutal. The poor suffer disproportionately and the only people who benefit are politicians and defence companies. While war is inevitable because politics is primarily rooted in violence – at least human history teaches us this –we have to realise that political conflicts have never been solved militarily.

> Lastly, I am very happy to see so many right wing commentators applauding Colonel Sophia Qureishi, but perhaps they could also equally loudly demand that the victims of mob lynchings, arbitrary bulldozing and others who are victims of the BJP’s hate mongering be protected as Indian citizens. The optics of two women soldiers presenting their findings is important, but optics must translate to reality on the ground otherwise it’s just hypocrisy. 

> When a prominent Muslim politicians said “Pakistan Murdabad” and was trolled by Pakistanis for doing so – Indian right wing commentators defended him by saying “he is our mulla.” Of course this is funny but it also points to just how deep communalism has managed to infect the indian body politic.

> For me, the press conference was just a fleeting glimpse – an illusion and allusion perhaps – to an India that defied the logic on which Pakistan was built. As I said, the grassroots reality that common Muslims face is different from what the government tried to show but at the same time the press conference shows that an India, united it its diversity, is not completely dead as an idea.

> Jai Hind

Anyone with even a basic literacy could understand that there is nothing in this text that either endangers India's sovereignty or demeans the women officers. On the contrary, Dr Mahmudabad praised the Operation Sindoor and Colonel Sofia Qureshi. Perhaps the Haryana Police and Women's Commission does not need an actual reason before arresting a Muslim.

The only thing Dr Mahmudabad said, that riled up the ruling party, is that he expressed hope that the right wing commentators would defend the minorities when they face mob lynchings, bulldozer raj, and hate-mongering.

The irony is perhaps lost on no-one, that Dr Ali Mahmudabad is now himself the subject of persecution that he spoke against.

**Since the beginning of the Indo-Pak conflict, the Modi Government has, on one side, attempted to portray a diverse and inclusive image for the global audience, while on the other side, silently allowed the targeting of Muslims in India. In the list of 59 dignitaries released by the ruling party for a “diplomatic outreach”, 11 are Muslims, the same party which has not one Muslim representative in Parliament.**

**Meanwhile, a regime of assault and oppression against the Muslims continues unabated, with a silent and sometimes open endorsement by the ruling party. A report, published by Association for Protection of Civil Rights, identified 184 hate crimes targeting Muslims, between 22 April 2025 and 8 May 2025. Alt News' Mohammed Zubair, who worked tirelessly to counter misinformation against India during the conflict, found himself being targeted by the BJP IT cell soon after.**

The arrest of Dr Mahmudabad and the persecution of Muslims across India betrays the Modi Government's doublespeak on unity.

Last few years and even more now I’ve noticed many Indians, want to “project” a good India image & do so while defending crap and absurdity - public hygiene, basic everyday infra, social behaviours of people,  and many more simple things. All in the name of “this is western propaganda” ….huh ?? wtf. If you say anything about India which is critical, you’re down right told you’re wrong. And they keep bleeting about 5TN economy, like sheep, with the basics of every life being sub-par.

They even do this when talking to people from other countries which is VERY embarrassing -because it makes us look like fools. This is even more prevalent among NRIs living outside India. 

How can one become great if you defend nonsense and don’t accept the reality and work towards improving it ??

india,all,Make in India is such a Scam. ,"We've built a product and only one of our components is outsourced  ( we need a factory for that ) everything is made in India. We wanted the people to experience what a good quality product is and when we explain them the product people love it but when they hear the price they always fall back to sub quality or Chinese products. I seriously don't understand, we even have people who have given us great feedbacks but they're not willing to buy it.  We started a company to solve a problem and embrace manufacturing in India . The govt schemes also don't support us and the startup route is such a hassle . I sometimes think I'm living a white man's dream in a third world nation. I even ponder if iphones were made in India without Apple , will it sell ? Why don't we as Indians understand premium products? Why are we ready to embrace foreign brands and not support local brands just because it cost 1000 more than some Chinese brand. We are not white labeling other Chinese products and calling it Indian. 

""Sabash beta , bhuat bariya Kiya "" yet they customise the product to their needs and when they see the final price , they'll be like "" reheney doh , itney mey toh XYZ brand kay 2 items ajayengay"" . 

It breaks my heart that i made this product after understanding their needs and yet it falls into a luxury product for them. 

Anyways it was a rant , I might just delete this post later.  But why can't we as an Indian believe that we CAN build premium products. We have the skills we have the talent we don't have that much infrastructure that's why it's costly but if we don't take the initiative, it will stay like this.

Yesterday I came from a flight from Munich to Delhi (now it’s not about north or south, i will post it Delhi subReddit too since the flight was for Delhi) my flight was delayed by 8 hours but i swear I didn’t even get close to being pissed but it changed I started seeing the people who will board the flight, flight experience is on another level.

I will say that in points so it is easy to read.

1.) All I was hearing loud Indians shouting their throats out while the other side of the airport was fine.

2.) People were blasting their instagram reels on full volume.

3.) Breaking queues while others waited for hours just to be behind a guy who doesn’t have basic human etiquettes.

4.) I never believed the stereotypes about stinking Indians because I never crossed them, but it changed. Is it too hard to carry a deodorant?

When i when boarded the flight

5.) Immediately there was a panic because people started sitting on seats which weren’t theirs’ because they wanna sit with their fam…meanwhile others are getting pissed and foight attendant had to come and fix.

6.) One guy asked for chocolates 7-8 times and even gave his meal twice, yes she didn’t say no because she cant but i could see that on her face. What’s the obsession with free stuff? All i am saying is that doesn’t leave a good impression 

7.) Women besides me, kept all the hand-rest space for herself and was so ignorant when i tried to take a bit of space by again forcing her elbows in. And also i was asked to change my seat (i didn’t)

8.) She took her shoes and the stench was so horrible that me and the guy(from Slovakia) beside me woke up and couldn’t complain because it’s just rude. I went to attendant and asked for a different seat but the flight was full and she said “yes we have problem with smell in this flight” gave me a balm to rub on my nostrils so that i dont smell. Thats what they use.

9.) While picking up the luggage a member of helping staff was helping a disabled lady and she was trying to see her luggage but people are sooooo ignorant and started blocking her because they want to go first.

Now I see why my friend takes business class, i will do the same.

All I am trying to say in this post is, if you are an individual who behaves like that, please understand everyone notices it, people are just too nice to point it out. You all are representing India so please behave like a human being.

india,all,Rape culture in india ,"posting a story on instagram won't make a difference. we need to change how we view women. Often, crimes against women get attention only after the victim is killed and only if society thinks she was ""respectable."" Social media and the news might briefly focus on the crime, but it rarely leads to real change. People quickly call for harsh punishments like ""hang the rapists"" but this just becomes a hot topic for news and then disappears into thin air without any true action upon those rapists.

Ask yourself: Are we truly making a difference, or are we merely engaging in performative activism? the reality is that posting on social media doesn't challenge the deeply rooted societal norms that allow such violence to persist.

Research shows that rape is not about arousal but about power and control. Some men feel a sense of superiority, viewing themselves as protectors and women as inferior, weak and pathetic beings. We need to introspect and understand that both men and women are equal. Nobody is superior. Think about how often we excuse inappropriate behavior towards women as ""boys being boys."" How frequently do we ignore patriarchal comments or actions from our friends and not even hold them accountable for their actions? how often do we judge women based on their appearance rather than their abilities? how frequently do we disrespect a woman for having multiple partners or being sexually active?
we live in a society that objectifies women as sexual objects and normalizes rape within marriage as if it's just a part of marriage. 

We are the same society that sensationalizes a woman's (tripti) sensuality rather than her other movies. We applaud when a woman from a particular community is raped, and we elect ministers or parties led by those with histories of sexual violence. it high time to realize that rapists are not born, but they are made by the members of our society. Rape culture is embedded in our day to day lives, and outrage after a horrific incident alone will not eradicate this culture. Rape is the result of a long history of patriarchy.

so, when you ask, ""how could they have raped her so brutally? how did they not shiver? are they even human?"" remember that we are all part of the system that allows this violence. it's up to us to address and change this culture. 

when i say we are all part of the system that allows this violence, i mean it's rape culture. rape culture is when sexual violence is accepted as normal. it's when patriarchy criticizes women for making their own choices or living independently and blames rape survivors for what happened to them. if a woman is raped, she was ""asking for it,"" and if a man is raped, he was ""weak,"" a ""sissy,"" or
""enjoyed it."" it promotes the idea of ""don't get raped"" instead of ""don't rape people.""

when you hear in response to a rape, ""she shouldn't have been drunk/wearing that/etc.,"" that is what ""rape culture"" refers to. it's rape culture when a woman is going about her business and men start catcalling her, either on the street or from a car. it's not about wanting to talk to her, it's about showing off to other men. do you know how scary it is to be followed by a group of strangers making derogatory comments? or when people make inappropriate jokes that make women uncomfortable, and if they voice their discomfort, it's often dismissed as 'just a joke' and they're told to 'stop being so sensitive.”

It’s messed up that women are expected to worry about their safety when it's the patriarchy making them unsafe. Catcalling isn’t just annoying—it’s scary, and brushing it off as a joke when someone asks you to stop just shows you don’t care about their feelings.

Calling for 'hanging rapists' without doing anything to actually dismantle rape culture is like thinking you can cure a disease by just getting rid of the sick.

india,all,"My fellow Indians planning to move abroad, please make an effort to learn about the new country’s culture and way of life. ","As a nation we need to accept that we have a lot of fucked up norms, practices and behaviours in our culture. A lot of people unfortunately are blinded to this due to nationalism or patriotism. And worse, people continue to practice this (in large groups often) even after they move abroad - a few examples; loud public celebrations where you litter everywhere and don’t clean up, using public transport without paying for it, invading people’s privacy and crossing boundaries, not following the basic social etiquettes. 

We’re moving to another country for “a better life”. People abroad have a better life not just because of the company they work for or their paycheques. Their lifestyle and culture has a lot to do with it. Western culture has its own flaws, but they have practices and mindsets that are far better than ours. There’s nothing wrong with adopting good things from the west and implementing it into your life while keeping the good things from our own culture. 

Nothing will replace your home and family in India, but I wish our people moved abroad wanting to create a second home and a new life. Instead we cling to India, and stick to our own people and live in an Indian bubble practicing the same toxicity and bs we were trying to leave anyways. People need to accept that you’re no longer in India and you need to make an effort to integrate into the new country’s culture and society. 

There’s a lot of racism going around towards Indians. While there’s nothing to justify racism, there are some valid criticisms on the way we live and behave abroad that we need to take seriously. 

Please educate yourself before moving abroad, leave out behaviours from our culture which isn’t accepted in your new country and try to integrate yourself into their society.

india,all,The Goverment e-Marketplace is an organized scam under the garb of ‘Make in India’,"I recently visited my cousin who joined as an assistant professor at NISER bhubaneshwar. I was shocked to hear about the extent of fraudulent merchandize being sold at grossly overpriced rates at the Goverment e-marketplace which is used by the central goverment universities as a public procurement platform. As a new faculty my brother is trying to setup his lab and is facing immense diffculty in getting quality equipment. Even simple electronics like computer hardware is faulty and becomes malfunctional after a month or so of use. And the registered companies are selling the electronics under strange names which you haven’t even heard of for standard hardware like monitors, desktop graphics cards etc. Everything comes with the *made in india* logo making an utter mockery of it. What is going on?!! My brother says a masters student just joined his lab and till now they haven’t been able to arrange a desktop workstation for his thesis work because of the utterly faulty stuff being sold at GeM. He works in a field which requires processing of tons of data so a computer is the most fundamental requirement for any research at all. 

If this is the scenario in one of the so called top institutes in the country, what could be the situation in state universities??",452,77,2024-01-17,Nirbhik,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/198t01d/the_goverment_emarketplace_is_an_organized_scam/

india,all,We have to admit girls aren't safe in India ,"We already know what horrors have happened in Bengal medical college. I used to think that crimes like these are limited only to Villages and illiterate people but no. 

I am myself from a top tier engineering college and I can admit, the amount of shit discussed in boys hostel in name of dark humour or dankness is just abhorrent. I won't go in details but you can understand. 
Recently I was conversing with my some of my female friends, and they shared one creepy story of an auto wallah, who tried to make them save his phone number and make them call on his phone, which they didn't of course! The auto wallah acted too friendly,and even told them that he can help them 'anytime'.

 The whole trip was so creepy and especially there was none of our guy friends accompanying them, and this happened at dusk time.  

And this is story of one girl, and I have talked to many others and they can recall atleast one such creepy event. 

My faith in humanity, atleast in India has went down to zero. I don't know what to really do or say. I really don't think so girls are really safe even in tier 1 cities or colleges, without being accompanied by a group of friends.

india,all,Open letter to Indian tourist from Nepal ,"Dear Indians,

We recognize and appreciate our close cultural, traditional, and culinary connections, which make us see you as brothers and part of our extended family. However, we have noticed that many Indian tourists do not adhere to appropriate ethics and values when visiting other countries, including Nepal. 

It's disheartening to see issues like littering and loud behavior becoming prevalent among some of you. Please remember to conduct yourselves respectfully when abroad. We are growing weary of the noise and the mess left behind. Is common sense really that uncommon?

With the heat waves, many Indians are traveling to Nepal, often by road. The main concern is the disregard for local rules. Do you realize the number of Indian drivers facing violence due to their arrogance? The mindset of ""I paid money, so I can do anything"" is fostering animosity between Nepalese and Indians.

Many of you arrive in buses, bringing all necessary materials and then cooking by the roadside. While we don’t mind this (though we encourage supporting local hotels), it is unacceptable to leave garbage behind. In Nepal, there is a small fee of 10-20 NRs (5-10 IC) to use public toilets, yet many choose to relieve themselves roadside to avoid this fee. If you cannot afford to pay for basic amenities, why come to Nepal at all? Please do not treat our country like your own dumping ground.

While we remain grateful for the aid and support from India, the behavior of some tourists is creating resentment. Let's strive to maintain the strong bond between our nations by respecting each other’s countries and following local rules and norms.

india,all,Fuck all Religion,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

india,all,Any gay couples in India on guiding how to make it work ?,"Hi 
I am a doctor based in Delhi . I am seeing a Keralite doctor for the past 1 year . His internalised homophobia makes him very uneasy when we spend more time with each other . We repeatedly break up as he says gays cannot survive in India . Everything is lost to them ..society, family , children . But simultaneously he is not able to muster the courage to say yes for marrying a woman . I guess his conscience stops him . 

Of late he has revealed his reality to his elder sister but she seems to be very orthodox in her approach ..suggesting singledom over a gay partnership. She thinks it is unimaginable for two guys to stay together in Kerala . The social stigma would be too much .Leave alone having a baby through surrogacy and all that .

I was just looking for some well settled gay couples in Delhi and India to please extend their helping hand in giving confidence to my dear friend that gay life need not be a cursed life .

He also agreed to go to counselling sessions. So any recommendations on that front would also be welcome .

india,all,I regret coming to go to Canada and it's only been a month since I stepped foot here (The reality of going to Canada as a student),"**Background:**

I tried to leave to Canada for the same reasons everyone tries to leave India, for a better life. I had a small startup company in India which was running well enough for a startup which shutdown when the pandemic hit and one of my partners committed suicide. It, along with a lot of other obvious factors made me want to leave India. I got into a college in Canada with a total fee of 22L for a diploma course and left at the end of October. One thing no one told me about is the housing crisis here and the insane living expenses.

These immigration agencies paint a rosy picture of this life in Canada full of opportunities and wonders where I get to work part-time and pay off my living expenses and student loans while living the best life possible. That can't be further from the truth. My father is a small railway clerk. He gets decent money enough to get me a student loan but that is it. We do not know anyone here in Canada, we have no friends or family here. The only people I know now is the people I met along the way. The college wasn't offering any accommodations and whatever it had was full. I tried looking for rooms and everyone's response here was basically that they'll talk when I'm in Canada. So I booked an Airbnb in Canada for 3 days, hoping to find a room during my stay there and left with a total of 400CAD (24,000rupees) in my hdfc forex card.

**Indians in Canada:**

It soon became clear the kind of people who try to come here mostly consist of wealthy Indians who can more than afford a good lifestyle here. Their parents are wealthy enough to fund them well enough and they also most likely have a family member living here. The second kind are the Indians who have some family member here and can live with them for a while until they can figure things out. People like me who have nothing and no one here are insanely rare and stupid to do something like this without proper financial backing.

Indians here are either the most kindest people you will find or they try to scam you. This one Punjabi guy sold me a 1$ travel adapter for 11$ seeing that I badly needed one while this other Punjabi guy gave me an uber ride of 30$ for free seeing how I was new to the city, both on the first day. Only Indians will scam you and only Indians will be as kind to you as one can be. Seems like there's no in-between.

**Worst day of my life:**

By the third day in Canada, when my Airbnb stay had ended, I had talked to this old lady about renting a room in her place for 1200$ initial deposit and this other guy for renting this other place for the same price. The plan was to go to the bank account and redeem my GIC money of 10,000$, roughly 6Lakh rupees. (which is the initial deposit I have to provide to Canada before I can get the visa), pay the rent and start living there. Things already seemed shaky but I had gone to a nearby bank the day before and they said I needed to have an appointment for that. This day, I had an appointment and I left as early as I can in the day with my total 70kgs of luggage (everything I got from India) to travel 90kms in bus to go to the bank, redeem the money and then take the room. If things go wrong, at least I'd have the money to fall back onto. My father had also sent me 1lakh just incase something goes wrong.

The bus did not stop where it was supposed to. The bus driver drove way past the bus stop when I was clearly asking him to stop and stopped somewhere far away in the next bus stop. It was a minor setback perhaps so I tried to take a bus back again to that stop, waited another half an hour before the bus came and he did the same thing again. He drove back again all over and stopped 2 stops over. Little did I know I had to pull a thin lever tied to either side and unless I do that, he will not stop no matter how much I ask him to. I was very far in another bus stop again. By then, I had dragged my luggage across at least 1km, changed 5 busses and hadn't eaten the whole day. The only ray of hope was to reach the bank somehow and claim the money.

I finally took another bus and somehow reached the bank. The lady, who was also indian, greeted me and then told me she cannot do the procedure to claim my money since it was 3:30 and the bank closes at 4pm. I hadn't gotten the money that my father sent me more than 2 days ago. I had a total of  100$ in my forex card. Apparently the bus service stops early since it was a Saturday, Banks are closed on Sundays, I was way outside the main city and so there aren't many taxi services, the cheapest airbnb costed me 70$ per night. If I book an Airbnb, I wouldn't have money for the uber ride. Even if I did take a bus there, how would I be able to afford the stay for Sunday ?

...

For the first time in my life I couldn't think anymore. I sat at the corner of the bank staring at my dying phone battery wondering what I was doing all the way here on the other side of the planet having left behind everyone who loves me and cares for me. I had everything back home. All my friends and family who could never imagine and can never know that I who would always take them around in my car would be so close to being homeless. I couldn't let them know either because I didn't want them to worry about me.

The bank lady approached me at closing time and asked me if everything is okay. Idk what happened but I couldn't help tearing up. I didn't look at her but I told her I don't know. She asked me if there's someone I can call who can pick me up and I said no. She then asked me if there is somewhere she can drop me and I said no. She asked me to try to find someone I can call. I scurried through my phone contacts to see if there is someone I can call and I found this number of this lady I met the previous day at a government office who told me to call her if I ever got into trouble. I called her up and she gave me another number. I called him up and he didn't answer but he gave me an address. And since I had some address and nothing more to lose, I told the bank lady that I have an address and she told me she will drop me there.

I had no clue where I was going since the text message only contained a name and an address. She drove me and left me on the sidewalk. I went up to the door and knocked. This Indian guy opens the door and asks me what I want. I tell him the name and then he immediately asks me to come in, goes out and carries my luggage inside. There were 5 guys sitting and watching the TV. I start explaining my situation and they ask me to sit down and relax first. This other guy was making dosas and he got me a couple in a plate. Once I had eaten, I told them what had happened and they told me not to worry since I found them and told me how they can crash in their sofa as long as I want to. They were insanely chill. We sat down and watched a movie and right that evening, they took me around in their car and found a room for me that I can rent. And then they sat me down and explained me everything I needed to know. I stayed there for another 2 days until I claimed my money and moved to the new place.

I couldn't be more thankful and its amazing how its always Indians who are truly there for me even though I have never met them ever before. Later I found out that my parents sensed that something was horribly wrong even though I had told them nothing and they hadn't been able to sleep for days until I showed them the room I was going to stay in, especially my father who knew my financial situation and got sick mentally torturing himself for not being able to provide me a better financial support.

&#x200B;

**Rent situation:**

The rent situation is horrible since Canada has the most inflated and expensive housing market on the planet. I am currently paying 500$ (30,000rupees all inclusive) a month for living in a hall in the basement of a house. There are 2 other guys living with me who has their own separate bedrooms since they pay more and the 3 of us have a common bathroom and a common bedroom. All of this in the basement of a house. It may sound pricey but that is kind of the going rate after they got inflated due to the pandemic. I might find a better deal elsewhere but they all get sold out faster than MI flash sale when those were big. But at least I get my little privacy when the other guys don't come this side to use the kitchen that is directly Infront of my hall.

Most Indian students here live in a ""sharing basis"" where they share a bedroom between 2 people that will cost each of them anywhere from 380$ - 500$ (22,000 - 30,000 rupees) a month. And these rooms are most likely in basements along with other such rooms. So in a basement there are often 2-6 students.

I heard of this one rent offer where at the Ground floor there were 8 guys living, on the 1st floor there was 10 guys living and at the basement of a house there were 8 GIRLS living. Sounds crazy but it has become a normal for Indians here. 8 guys/girls in one floor means 4 bedrooms in one floor sharing a common kitchen, hall and a bathroom. It costs 350$ (20,500 rupees) for each person. It got filled in less than a day.

&#x200B;

**Transport:**

A 10km travel will take 9 minutes in a car, 30 minutes in a bicycle and 2 hours in a bus. It is hard to live without a car here. The country is designed for cars. And the busses, you pay about 4$(240rupees) depending on where you are and that will give you a pass that you can use to roam for about 2 hours or less wherever the bus company operates. ~~Yes that's right, there is no government run transport here.~~ This country is a late stage capitalist utopia.

If you want to buy a car, you will get an amazing sedan for cheap. But the monthly insurance can be anywhere from 180$ - 300$ (10,500 - 17500 rupees) a month. The maintenance costs are expensive. Every winter you will have to swap regular tires for winter tires which are expensive.

**Food:**

An egg costs 25 rupees each, cilantro costs 60rupees, tomato costs 70 rupees each and milk costs 105 rupees per liter. Food is very expensive. And so is junk food. This may look manageable but they really add up when you want a proper diet.

**Mobile Internet:**

One thing Indians take for granted is their mobile internet / jio. Mobile plans in Canada cost 50$ (3000rupees) per month for 8GB of data which is standard here and mobile plans aren't universal, they change for each individual costumer. If you can bargain good and find good places (with no Indians scamming you like the Indian who scammed me with my plan), you may find 40$(2400rupees) for 12GB per month which sounds bs compared to the 2GB per day plan you get in jio for 600 rupees per month in india.

&#x200B;

This will all be perfectly manageable since we will be working part-time don't we ?

**Part-time Job situation:**

Well in theory, yes. You can manage all expenses if you work part-time. But it is complicated.

Students get a 20 hour per week work permit. And they all pay minimum wage which is 14.35$/hour (829 rupees/hour) which seems to be the only thing students who come here are looking at. Indian university degree or experience will not be respected in Canada. They don't care who you were in India. They only offer minimum wage, take it or leave it. But even that for 20 hours a week should give around 1000$ (60,000rs) per month minus the travel expenses right ? Well that is if you can find a job that will give you full 20 hours. I got a job that is only paying me 12 hours a week which adds only up to 600$ (36,000rs) a month of which 500$ is going for rent.

The jobs that give full 20 hours often involve manual labor like lifting weights of up to 20kgs frequently. It is basically the lowest job there can be in this country. They may even pay a little more that minimum wage but they are often in far off locations that consume money in transport. Indians can totally do that but that still is not enough since the food+rent will take up all the money. And unexpected expenses keep pouring in unannounced.

So too many Indians work for ""cash jobs"" after the finish their main job which is basically illegal work that is paid in cash so the government cannot track it, which is often dangerous as you can guess and a some even get scammed. But this has become the normal. Main job + Cash job is what one needs to survive and manage expenses and have some savings too.

So basically whatever time the college takes + 20 hours of cash job + 20 hours of main job and the rest of the time you're too tired to do anything else.

&#x200B;

**Canadians:**

Canadians are extremely polite. They are very very nice people in general but they also seem paranoid of other people. Indians don't really mix with the Canadians very easily. They stay separate and in their own circles and I understand why.

**Depression:**

Students here can't and won't tell the struggles they face here to their parents or even their friends back home. The pictures of them posing in these pristine streets and behind expensive cars does not show a true picture of what's happening here to them. Living in basements and working factory or minimum wage jobs after living a good life in India and away from loved ones is not going to be good for anyone's mental health. Indian students ""get used to"" whatever happens here.

&#x200B;

**And then what after getting a PR ?**

Work insanely hard, hustle, finish college, get a job after college, go head over heels to get a PR and then what ?

I live very far away from the city and in this tiny town where I had a lunch with a kind Canadian family of 5 who was paying a rent of 2400$ (1.4Lakh) per month for a small basic decent house. And they tell me how they are struggling to make ends meet. And the houses here start at 5 crore rupees all the way out here in this tiny town and you can guess the city prices. Unless one gets a VERY GOOD job here or has rich parents, buying a house here seems impossible. Apartments don't really cost that much less. In contrast, the 200sq.yard duplex house I lived in the city back home, had a rent of 10,000 rupees (170$) per month. The rent I'm paying here will get me a luxury apartment in the center of the city back home.

I personally cannot imagine living in a country where I will need both mine and my spouse's income combined just to live a decent life and still always be at the risk of going homeless any day. The land prices at the outskirts of my city was costing 24lakhs for 200sq.yards right before I left. I cannot imagine life where in a city where basic commodities can be a struggle.

In India the wages may be low. But the if half your income is goes for accommodation, you'd be able to buy the house instead if renting it. My father pays 1/6th of his income for accommodation. And an average salary of 30,000rs per month like mine paying 8000rs for a full house rent, still left about half my salary for savings which could do a lot in Indian economy.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

The cars may not be as cheap, the roads may not be as pristine (although that's slowly changing), the house may not be made of wood, the trees may not come in red color, the street selfies may not help parents brag and the roadside people may not be as polite. But I will have my self respect and mental health.

Being in India is not easy but it's worse out here unless you're loaded, you have an amazing job or your dad's a politician or something. I think about my family a lot and friends that I left behind to pursue what exactly? The pandemic pushed me and a lot of others to despair and we thought coming here would solve something. Canada saw a record intake of Indians this year and I imagine lots of them were pushed to despair by the pandemic like I was.

India is an amazing country despite all its negative political bs. My asthma inhaler costs 140 rupees in India, 1800 rupees in Canada and 17000 rupees in US apparently. India heavily subsidizes medicines that I have always taken for granted like most other Indians. Food is very cheap and road side food is ultra cheap while being delicious. People may not be as polite but they are real. Internet is surprisingly the cheapest on the planet. Literally everything is cheap and not just that, one gets to live a dignified life with loved ones.

&#x200B;

Post Note:

This post does not apply to anyone who is rich or has a good job. Most Indians aren't very rich. Middle class Indians often seem to look at the rich Indians here and come here searching for that life. A lot of times, it's the taxes paid by the hard earning Indian public that got them that Lamborghini.

&#x200B;

Edit 1:

1. Of course I wasn't prepared for this. Anyone with two braincells can see that. I don't want to be reminded of how unprepared I was. And I came to Canada with only 400$ because that's all my father could afford to give me at that time. We are poor. It was either go now or lose the 10lakh fee I paid. It's really hard to be prepared when poor.
2. The nuances and the intricate details are hard to research online. Like how was I supposed to know I have to pull that thin rope placed in the corner of the bus off of google ? How does one search for these things ?
3. I never said I'm smart, I said I was desperate. Desperation makes people make stupid decisions. When life seems to be falling apart rapidly, the first instinct is to try to fix it anyhow. Mistakes have been made.
4. I am well aware of the costs way before coming here. I'm trying to inform others. Also it's one thing to know the costs beforehand and another to actually buy groceries at that cost.",7389,1320,2021-12-03,fredrichniche,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/r7rej5/i_regret_coming_to_go_to_canada_and_its_only_been/
india,all,"Making 50LPA in India - Got a job offer from sweden, looking for opinions","I'll keep this short but your experience will help me make a decision. So here are some important points.

&#x200B;

Professionally -

* My full time job pays me 36LPA
* I have a couple of long term freelancing gigs that pay me about 20LPA additionally
* I have a job offer from stockholm, sweden from a very very reputed company that has millions of concurrent users (don't get into the ""check if its a scam"" argument, that's all done and verified)
* This Swedish job is going to pay me 660k SEK/Year + 100k SEK / year as bonus. I have been assured that bonus has been 110% for the past 4 years and the trend is likely going to continue.

&#x200B;

Personally -

* I am 32 years of age
* Married and recently became a dad (jan 31st!). So my infant kid is 3 months old at the moment
* My wife was working before our marriage and she decided to become a housewife after.
* She's willing to learn swedish and start with small jobs in a few months once we get there and eventually work her way up
* I have been working with foreigners for the past 10 years and my English is very well understood by them and I have no language barriers (except Swedish which is not mandatory for this job)

&#x200B;

My observations -

* Its a well known fact that Europe (or Sweden for that matter) isn't a ""get rich quick"" country. You'd rather to go San Fransisco if that was your idea. I personally hate the idea of moving to the US, not that it matter because nobody has offered me a job from the states yet.
* I am not looking to get rich quick either, I make plenty of money here if that was the case. I believe its the ""quality of life"" as they put it is what I am looking for. I am not entirely sure what that means as I've never been to Europe.
* If I wanted to move, this is the time to move because my kid is only 3 months old. So he wouldn't face any identity crisis as he would actually grow up with locals. Instead of moving when he's more than 7 years of age and already going to some school in India

&#x200B;

My questions -

* Do you think its worth moving?
* If you've lived in any Nordic (or European countries), how is it better than India apart from the Government assistance and in general more sophisticated people. I hope you understand I am not saying India is bad, I am just saying that you'd usually want to avoid getting into an argument with someone on the street here.
* I have already negotiated and they did bump it up from 625k to 660k SEK/year and was told that this is the best that they've ever offered. This works out to about 40k SEK/Month in Hand. I currently have a few ongoing loans in India which amount to about 75k INR per month.  Do you think I'll be able to save and send atleast 12-14k SEK/month back home in India to pay off these loans?

For those of you wondering, I work as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) and a similar role has been offered in Stockholm.

PS -  I am not being sent ""on site"" by some Indian company, nor am I  hired because I am an Indian (cheaper labour). They selected me after interviewing 50+ candidates across Europe.

And if you have any other opinion in General that you want to share. I would prefer you stay away from ""get out of India, its going to shit"" kinda of comments as I am well aware of that aspect of things.",205,200,2021-03-30,srethrowaway808,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/mg7da2/making_50lpa_in_india_got_a_job_offer_from_sweden/

india,all,People of India : Stop adopting Huskies,"Okay so recently i came across a couple who've bought a husky from pet shop, why i mean just why? They can't survive in tropical climates of India. They have double coated fur (they're not called 'Siberian' huskies in vain) which is there to keep them protected from winter but as you all know that unless you're living in Himachal Pradesh or Sikkim it's not that cold in most places of India, then why to make poor animal suffer? Even if you keep them in room having AC or whatever it's not suitable for them. They're not machines, they need natural weather and atmosphere. I've seen people keeping them indoors under AC, that just makes it worse and makes them prone to multiple skin diseases and then when they can't afford the cost of keeping a pet they just abandon their pets. 

Here's the thing, pet shop owners are selling huskies in India because people are buying them, if nobody buys them then they won't sell them just like before. In fact almost nobody(in India) knew about huskies before the age of internet.

As an animal lover it just hurts my soul to see things like these, especially when done by 'educated morons'. Just becuase you have money you can't buy everything in this world. Pets are not toys, they're living beings. If you want to have a pet then why don't keep a pet that's suitable for indian climate. 

It's my humble request to all of you, pets are not symbol of your status. Let's make the world better together for every living being🙏🏻",5164,576,2023-04-16,Ok-Middle-5746,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/12of2kn/people_of_india_stop_adopting_huskies/
india,all,Indian family and their obsession with their daughter's Vagin*. ,"So okay, where should I start from. Well I have a friend from Pune, we were close and I also went to his house. He has a uncle who has a son (17) and a daughter (24). So the daughter is working in finance and she liked a guy from her office or something, but she never told that at her house because her parents are like ultra strict. Anyways, she was dating him ig and I guess they spent the night outside now and then, but one day some neighbouring aunty saw them on a bike together and then it was hell on Earth. 

My friend's uncle made a huge commotion in front of everyone, and that too at 6 in the morning, woke up my friend and his family from sleep too. He was triggered because his daughter was doing ""immoral"" act and took the family's reputation down in the gutter and you know what. By 8 AM, the whole society came to know about this, the girl was traumatised, and as of now, she is like disowned by her family. 

If you have read till here, thanks, the real problem starts from here. Remember the son? The guy is a grade A asshole, he is 17 but does all kind of stuff that even adults don't do, he drinks, goes to a Hooka bar, and also cheats and goes in questionable places with college guys. His parents and everyone in the family knows it, but you know what's the reaction of the father is? ""Let him be, he is young and he has his needs, only thing I say him is to not make anyone pregnant"". Yes, the guy is a total asshole, shit in studies, spends all his father's money, and still is adored by everyone, just because he has a penis and not a vagina. 

The worst part comes is that the father has a business in construction, and the factory will go to his son. They didn't even think of giving the factory to their daughter, they even considered giving it to my friend, his nephew, but never his daughter because ""she will marry and the factory will go to another family."" The Uncle is a BTech graduate from Pilani, Aunt did BA in Economics from Lady Shri Ram College (never did a job though), but their mindset is from 18th century. 

They are a close family, so they talked about the girl in the ""family meeting"", and they said how India is losing its culture and values, and Western culture is taking over, aka saying that her daughter's sex life = USA propaganda, while their son's nightlife = Mahabharata. 

And this is the story of a family living in a posh locality in Pune, the village life in India is unimaginable. But I really don't understand the reason we are so r*tarded in our thinking. Why the family's reputation is always in a women's vagina, and men are literally free to even rape (if they do it correctly, that is without anyone knowing). Why education hasn't helped in uplifting the societal complex and why we are so backwards when it comes to our women. 

Also not talking about the shit they share on family's WhatsApp, full day Modi Modi and how Muslims are taking away Hindu's daughter. I mean if the guy was Muslim, there would be honour killing and shit, and yea, he also asked the guy's name before asking anything else to the daughter. I really don't have any hope left in the country, when the old people are sexist and backward, and the 'youth' is also sexist, backward and have no self confidence or self respect. We will at least need 3-4 generation and a huge de-religionism from our country, because Hindus or Muslims, our scriptures are fundamentally sexist and sus. Sadly, western values regarding women are superior to our cultural values, individual freedom>>>family values always, and if it's not, then we are in the wrong. 

TL;DR: Daughter has to take up all the shit from the family, while son is free to have sex and enjoy life, dual standard of the society and overall generalisation of sexism in India.

india,all,Unwelcome In New Zealand ,"I’m a 29-year-old Indian guy who moved to New Zealand two years ago, hoping for a fresh start. I had this ideal image of NZ being welcoming and multicultural, but my experience has been far from that, unfortunately. I wanted to share my story and hear from others who might be in the same boat.

Don’t get me wrong, there are good people here. But I’ve faced more racism than I expected. From random strangers yelling stuff at me on the street to getting weird looks or rude comments at work because of my accent or appearance. Even in social settings, I feel like people avoid me, or I get treated differently. Sometimes it's subtle, like people talking over me or excluding me from conversations. Other times, it's blatant—like being told to ""go back to where I came from.""

I’m trying my best to integrate—learning the Kiwi slang, understanding the culture, and keeping an open mind. But there are moments when it gets exhausting. I never felt like an outsider growing up in India, but here, even after two years, I feel like I don’t fully belong.

I guess I’m just looking for some advice or solidarity. Have any of you faced similar issues after moving abroad? How do you cope with the feeling of being an outsider or dealing with racism, especially when it hits so unexpectedly?

It’s tough because I really want to make New Zealand my home, but there are days I wonder if I made the right choice. How do you handle the mental toll of this, and does it get any better over time?

Thanks for reading and for any advice or personal experiences you can share.

india,all,iPhone pricing in India on-par with the USA,"This is for the base models that are assembled in India, not the Pro models which are still imported from China and attract duty.

iPhone 15 (128GB) - USD 799 vs INR 79,900

My title looks incorrect on the surface, but we must remember one important factor. The iPhone in India is INR 79,900 including **18% GST**.

iPhone 15 USD retail price is USD 799 **before** state-wise sales tax. 

At today's exchange rate of 83:

USD 799 \* 83 = INR 66,317. 

INR 66,317 + **18% GST** = INR 78,254. Not far off from the official Indian retail price of Rs. 79,900.

Apple is no longer looting the Indian consumer with high prices. The iPhone is expensive because of **18%** tax being levied on us.

For someone who can avail of the GST set-off, it no longer makes sense to try and get it from abroad. 

Writing this post because in another thread, lot of people are commenting that even though Apple is assembling in India, they are not passing on the benefits to Indian consumers. That is simply not true. The actual price of the iPhone in India is INR 67,711 pre-tax, which is almost priced on-par with the USA.

Just wanted to spread knowledge on the real reason iPhone is expensive in India, i.e. 18% GST.",2991,736,2023-09-13,SquareTarbooj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/16hg3hl/iphone_pricing_in_india_onpar_with_the_usa/
india,all,India is Making wrong Headlines in the global news,"From China, UK, US, Australia, Canada all of the mainstream news outlets are carrying news from India about ""Hindu Nationalism"", ""Hindu Extremism"", ""Hindu mob"".

Thus coming to conclusion that Modi is encouraging Hardliners to do these things.

from Huffpost US, Washington Post, NYT, CNN, Reuters, Guardian, Foreign Policy, even FT, Economist and many 100's of Global news outlets are having editorial's cautioning Modi and India. some of it is reaching Europe, China as well.

india,all,"WhiteHatJr filed a 20 CRORE defamation case against me, Pradeep Poonia.","So WhiteHatJr Filed a 20 CRORE defamation lawsuit against me. 

1. The whole argument from their side is BS. 
2. They finally accepted that Wolf Gupta is imaginary. Why didn't they accept this earlier?
3. Check the document, and see for yourself all their hollow claims. The link at the end.
4. I am looking for lawyers. Got a lot of numbers. Talking to them right now. 
5. One good lawyer suggested I back out, sign an apology and end it, said will cost you 30k rupees only, and that's it. 
6. I won't back out. (Although my parents still don't know what mess I have indulged myself into. But I feel I will be able to handle them.)
7. Why did WhiteHatJr take this risky step? Like it seems like it won't go in their favor in public. Yet they took this desperate step. Because they know what I know and they want me to stop sharing it out there in public. Their lawsuit is to get interim junction and make me stop showing it to everyone. And even try to take down all my videos/posts/Reddit everything.
8. In the past 9 days, I tried if some big publication would write about it. But no one did. (Apart from one, Thanks to [Morning Context](https://themorningcontext.com/indias-whitehatjr-is-startup-hell/) and Ashish K Mishra for the article).
9. So what is it that they are trying to bury so hard?
10. This spreadsheet, the LIST of all the videos/tweets/links/posts/LinkedIn/Facebook/IG/ quora/Reddit/(9gag also) they reported and took down. The list contains over 700 such links. (If I included the comments of the parents that they were removing, the list would be over 2k)
11. Here is the List: Download, find these people, and tell them what happened to their posts. If your content was also taken down find it here: 
<As per court orders I have removed the link>

12. There is more. The whole company reeks of lies and deceit. Once I said I will find out who Wolf Gupta and who all these fictitious kids are. Now that the media is silent, here is the birth story of such kids and their 'apps'. And you tell me if I was wrong when I called this company a FRAUD. 

<removed after Delhi HC orders on 24/11/2020 >



Neither the kids existed, nor the apps. And they really created a $300 million company around it.

If that is now fraud what it? Now I think now you can understand why the threats, why this case, why they are talking so much risk but not looking at their own mistakes. This proof was shared with one journalist but they ignored it. Now you can understand why the media was silent.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, what do I do here? 

I have three options. 

1. Back out. Apologize and move on. Which I won't.
2. Hire a normal lawyer on my own and they would drag this case and make me exhausted. 
3. As seen in many tweets today, many of you asked me to start a fund and where all can chip in and hire the best lawyer possible. 

Please write in the comments which option should be taken. If option #3, please quote how much can you contribute for real, also suggest to me how to start a fundraiser and what platforms are good for it. WhiteHatJr has already spent 25 lakhs on preparing this case. So legal fights are costly. I alone can only go to a point until my pockets are empty.

2. Some one please cross-post this in different subreddutts.
3. WRITE about this issue. Let's not wait for the media. I have posted most of the proofs on youtube and my Twitter. Please write blogs etc about this. Can someone also try to post this issue on LinkedIn, I am banned from there. 
4. Share etc do all that. You see how to spread this news now. Make a small poster kind of thing, those seem to work better than such long texts. 
5. I might not be able to reply to comments and DMs today, please don't mind.

india,all,Frustrating trying to do anything in India as a foreigner. ,"The experience in India has been great, except that I need a phone number to do anything! When I went to order food at KFC, or McDonalds, the kiosk asks me for a phone number. When I want to order food at 3 am (because jetlag), all of the delivery apps need an indian phone number. Most shops, even large Western food chains like Mcd, subway, etc, don't accept international payment cards. My credit or debit cards throw an error on the machine with 'international cards not supported'. To get access to UPI, i need to go through a multi day process with a provider like cheq. 

It's really frustrating. India has grown exponentially with its technology, but no thought was put into how foreigners would work in this system. Buying a sim card requires ID, proof of Indian citizenship, etc, which I obviously don't have as a foreigner. I don't necessarily want an Indian phone number either, but it doesn't make sense to me why these delivery apps don't accept foreigners. Hell, they could even charge extra fees to cover any fees.

india,all,Starting a business in India is impossible for ordinary people.,"For a long time we have heard about how Indians prefer a salaried job and don't like becoming entrepreneurs. Even our parents and society discourage us from starting our business and recommend getting a stable job. 

I used to think the reason behind it was just fear and ignorance but a recent incident with my cousin has opened my eyes. 

My cousin(M32) who was working in an multinational corporation as an engineer recently quit his job and came back to India to start a metal works factory. The whole thing was troublesome from the start. there were thousand approvals to be gotten and they needed to be gotten from different places. The problem was no one department would approve all the things they had to but would keep sending us to other department to get some other thing approved before they would approve one thing. 

Worst part was each one of those bureaucrats would take a long time to see the file and we had to pay the clerk a lot of money each time. Last straw was when the officials wanted an NOC from a temple before approving construction. We had all documents related to land and it was rezoned legally into a commercial property a decade ago. But the land was 800 meters away from a temple and still the temple authority had to give NOC saying they don't have any rights on the land. When we approached the official he said it we need to get a letter form revenue department. The official at revenue department said it would take 3 months and asked us for 1 crore if we wanted it quick. Cousin had already spent an enormous sum on land and rest was barely enough to build the factory and he was planning to get business loan. 

We tried to get a letter signed by the temple priest but that was not sufficient and we had to get one from endowments department. The person at that department wants 20 lakhs again. 

Everyone kept saying ""you are starting factory and are rich. can't you even pay this much? if you don't have money why are you doing business?'. 

Worst part was how everyone just accepted this as the default. apart from the ED and RD, We had paid lot more money in bribe already. My cousin gave up on this venture and decided to just keep the land as it as an investment. He wrote off the bribes as loss and is going back abroad to start the factory in another country. 

Government keeps barking about make in India but this is the reality. This is why we will remain in service industry. 

Edit- This is in Andhra. We did not complain to anti corruption bureau as some of the officials are well known for their connections to ruling party. My cousin has already made preparations to start the factory (smaller than the original plan) in Vietnam. He has left for Vietnam for the same.

Edit 2 - Many have commented about how I was just whining and how it is just a glass ceiling. Some have even said i copy pasted a movie plot(I had to go and the movie shivaji after reading multiple comments). 

It wasn't just the approvals and NOC. The long times taken and the way there was no proper information regarding the process took its toll on my cousin. We could have paid someone to get this all done and we were approached by many about the same. They all had similar requirements. We had to pay a lot of money in cash. Now, I'm not even sure which bank would let you withdraw lakhs of rupees in cash but the whole thing wore out my cousin. He had his friend investing in the venture and his friend too backed out after all these things and left my cousin unable to proceed further. They have both decided to go to Vietnam.",3253,493,2023-07-31,Broke_as_a_Bat,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/15e8h8y/starting_a_business_in_india_is_impossible_for/

A humble request to the future aspirants planning to come to the US on loans

I came to the USA in January 2023 for my master’s degree, driven by hopes for a better future. I left behind a decent-paying job and took out a $20,000 loan to make this dream possible. However, the initial days were extremely tough. I was constantly second-guessing even small purchases, feeling homesick, and crying during calls with my parents. On top of that, I struggled to find on-campus work due to internal changes.

During this difficult time, I was also hunting for internships. After grinding relentlessly, I managed to land one that covered most of my expenses, and the company was kind enough to offer me a full-time role afterward. Things seemed to be improving.

But starting in May, life took a series of unfortunate turns. I was involved in an accident, had falling-outs with close friends, and tragically, I had to move out of my apartment after some unforeseen things happening in my old room. As if that wasn’t enough, I’ve now received a layoff notice from my employer last month to leave by end of September.

This series of events has taken a toll on me financially as well. I’ve had to sell my vehicle at a $4,000 loss+ repairs for accident, and I’m gradually selling off other belongings. I’ve still not paid off my student loan. Sadly, I wasn’t able to fulfill my goal of bringing my parents to visit the US, and instead, I’m relying on them for financial support to cover my remaining $12,000 loan from my bachelor’s degree in India.

Now, I’m back to job hunting, reaching out to people like crazy, but the job market is brutal. I keep facing rejections, and the dreaded question, “Will you now or in the future need sponsorship?” keeps coming up. It’s disheartening, especially when my previous work experience doesn’t seem to help me land new opportunities. I’m beginning to question whether returning to my home country would be better for my mental health.

Losing my job has been incredibly difficult to accept. I’ve always excelled in life, so this failure feels like a harsh reality check. I’m struggling with the feeling that I’ve been carried by luck until now, and I feel like a burden to those around me. Despite the encouragement from my parents and relatives, I’ve lost my motivation, and I’m not sure where things went wrong.

I’m sharing this for those who are considering coming to the US for study and work. The challenges are real—OPT can be difficult, and employers and recruiters are often tough to navigate. Job hunting feels like an uphill battle, and if you’re from a middle-class family, the financial burden can be overwhelming if things don’t go as planned. The market doesn’t seem likely to boom anytime soon. Companies are cutting jobs, experimenting with AI, and focusing on boosting their stock prices, while job seekers face rejection after rejection. Even when you say you don’t need sponsorship, you might still be dismissed because of future sponsorship concerns, even though companies can fire you at any time.

**Maybe I’m just venting, but I want future aspirants to carefully consider the financial and emotional challenges of pursuing opportunities in the US.

india,all,What's up with Indian meme pages demeaning and degrading Russian women?,"When foreigners say that Indian men are different breed altogether, we shouldn't be surprised. Just look at Indian pages how they demean Russian women. They will give you everything for 6000 rs. Earlier when I saw these memes, i thought may be, it is by few stupid memers but it has increased so much that even bigger pages on FB and insta has started making meme on this. I just want to ask if you hate generalization so much than how can you demean the women of an entire country? If someone from Russia sees these things, what would they think about us? Already Indian men have really bad reputation in the world due to constant demanding of bobs and vegana on random inboxes and now these guys have started to think about Russians for 6000?
It's really shameful that these people don't know how to respect women, doesn't matter if she is your sister, your girlfriend, from India or from Russia.
