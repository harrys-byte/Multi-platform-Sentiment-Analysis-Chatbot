dOZX3_Y4kKg,Modi tryed to ban this channel
dOZX3_Y4kKg,"India will continue to move forward. However, it will be slow. Some of the things he mentioned are right. Bureaucracy is worse in India. Bullet train delays, Navi Mumbai airport delays, and Vizhinjam port delays are some of the best/worst examples of land acquisition, activism, and bureaucracy.

This British man, however, forgets that his country is already behind India. It will continue to do so."
dOZX3_Y4kKg,Sad fact
dOZX3_Y4kKg,This needs genuine understanding.
dOZX3_Y4kKg,India needs to be recolonise
dOZX3_Y4kKg,"But Mr Blackwell, India still thinks it holds the biggest trump card of them out by skilfully playing both sides : it can be a vital part of BRICS and yet be invited to the G7 summit; it can be part of Asia and yet be a member of Quad and its Indo-Pacific containment; it can rub shoulders with Putin and shake hands with Trump in the same week. Could you do a video dissecting this sophisticated art?"
dOZX3_Y4kKg,"India still leaving

dOZX3_Y4kKg,"Who is this idiot of 1st degree who are trying to compare a hard-core Chineese-CPC with the largest democracy of the world, shows this commentator has very poor knowledge about India or he is tagged in prior to 2000 era. My advice to this prejudice mind would be to update his mental software and also the knowledge about India.
It is new India under Modi. Gone are the days when west used to lecture India but things are now reversed as India shows respect to others but cares none even not USA and operation SINDOOR is the latest example, a country with one of the best performing arsenals."

dOZX3_Y4kKg,"My hats off to you, Mr. Harrison Blackwell. Your channel happens to be the most favourite one to me. I devour the contents like a glutton and ruminate it later over hours. Will you please compile them all under one name to make and publish a book for the convenience of the world. I would purchase 50 copies of it and that's a solemn declaration."
dOZX3_Y4kKg,A few developments here and there don't make the whole country developed. India as a whole is dirtier than many African countries. The people are very poor. India ranks low in HDI. India can never become a developed country because its citizens is racially inferior to citizens of most countries and adapted to live in shitty places.
dOZX3_Y4kKg,"Thanks for your brilliant exposure, Sir"
dOZX3_Y4kKg,"China started make in China policy in 1978 but India started make in India policy in 2014. That's mean 36 years deferent between China and India but India has been being better more and more since 2014 for make in India policy Now' Indian economy, manufacturing, infrastructure, express ways, highways, village roads, train ways, bullet train, education, science and technology, satellites and defence weapons etc are progressing day by day and India shall be better than China after 2040 for everything. Let me say something regarding Chinese products because Chinese products are not good quality but Indian products are better quality. Lastly India is democratic country but not China. That's why all the people of India can speak freely against Govt of India but all the people of China can't speak freely against Govt of China."
dOZX3_Y4kKg,"Just another pakistani channel using AI voice....😂😂.
Pakistanis are great social media warriors.
In real world they *** in their pants."
dOZX3_Y4kKg,"They often yap about how india is so great vishawguru and no 1 country and their religion and culture is advanced or better than other people while the ground reality is they are the highest in number in any country immigration. And most importantly majority of people don't question politicians they just spoke for them like a spokesperson,so problem is not in the gov but the real problem is Indian people itslef they have the mindset of fighting each other for religion and casts."

MGWYD4KBZpQ,"Made in India? Really? It's a well known fact that Indians (India) buy made in China's finished product or spare parts and disassembled them before re-assembling them with certain parts of made in india into a finished product, before re-labelling them as ""made in India"". eg. drones.

MGWYD4KBZpQ,"🤭🤣😂😅😆Made in India? Really? Despite Western and Indian efforts to hype up Indian CEOs and Indian talents and Indian tech, reality prevails in the end. Not one single Indian could make any DeepSeek moment or any TikTock moment. Over-paid, over-hyped and over-rated. 🤭"

7jQYRdoV9RQ,Amul chocolate is garbage. It’s utter garbage.
7jQYRdoV9RQ,"Let me give a view being an Indian..definitely The Indian products qre cheaper but they also mean inferior quality of products ..the ingredients used arw very very cheap and they also use different taste enhancers which are even banned in many countries ...palm oil and added sugars are most common ,they use it nearly all the products. Basically they are made to be addictive."
7jQYRdoV9RQ,"You said India make cheaper products, but in Indian rupees these are not cheaper!"
7jQYRdoV9RQ,"Difference in INDIAN ONES: Palm Oil, internationally banned ingredients 😢"
7jQYRdoV9RQ,Indian regulations in food are poor. Unhealthy as its way sugary and less quality.
7jQYRdoV9RQ,Food poison kaledha bro 😮😢
7jQYRdoV9RQ,"Bro read the ingredients use , compare the quality of contents"
7jQYRdoV9RQ,I would NEVER touch any of these packages mass produced junk things made anywhere honestly....

India is capable for making thin slices but they are not doing , I wonder both are same brand with same base for making chips but why thicker slices in India?😂😂😂😂"
7jQYRdoV9RQ,"Interesting video my sir,love from india,you gotta try pani puri too"
7jQYRdoV9RQ,ISN'T HE PEWDEIEIE? WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE PEWDIEPIE? 😭 pin this comment.

7jQYRdoV9RQ,Bro those are not Indian pringles!! They are imported from Malaysia man 💀
7jQYRdoV9RQ,"Hershey candies taste fine to me but kind of plain. But I'm American, I'm used to it!"
7jQYRdoV9RQ,KitKat straberry my favourite
7jQYRdoV9RQ,"you should have tried Pringles made in India, not imported one"
7jQYRdoV9RQ,This Bullshit is simply liking Indian food just to get many views/like from India because India is the most populated country in the world..stop this you butthole we knew you lied to us by liking our foods just for your own benefits
7jQYRdoV9RQ,"Just because your audience is indian you dont have to lie about the shit quality as an NRI I know how pathetic the taste difference and quality of ingredients are in india. The sugar content alone in kitkat in india is so differnet, blud just lied in the first 2mins of the video about the kitkats. Such a scam 😂😂😂"

7jQYRdoV9RQ,"After alll this comparison , i say i better stay in India and enjoy better flavors n taste to my buds"
7jQYRdoV9RQ,The American products have used healthier ingredients.
7jQYRdoV9RQ,I always confuse this guy with pewdipie
7jQYRdoV9RQ,Amul dark chocolate orange flavour and fruit & nut are so good and they also contain 55% cacao which is very healthy. The 70% and 90% are too bitter but suitable for health conscious people.
7jQYRdoV9RQ,You're not American are you

7jQYRdoV9RQ,"Ur  taste bud has really got into inferior products 👍 
Well all for views 😮‍💨"
7jQYRdoV9RQ,"This guy judging the product by packaging don't know about the quality products 
Sugar> coco powder 
Palm oil> vegetable oil 
Maida> wheat 
Food pharma is just his best to get aware of Indian inferior products while this kind a guys makes the people believe we have"
7jQYRdoV9RQ,I don't like Oreos. Its literally made with all Sugar! 😢
7jQYRdoV9RQ,"I don't actually like our Indian  commercial processed snacks and sweets that much. Ours are super salty, spicy, too tangy or damn sugary.  And people here don't even realise how bad it can be to our health. The sugar content in every Indian confectionary food are dangerously high! 

That's why it's always recommended to have healthy home cooked food."
7jQYRdoV9RQ,Why you look like PewDiePie?
Tdj4cbV6T3w,You Nailed it 👌
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"भारत माँ की यही पुकार,
मेक इन इंडिया, हो साकार।
उद्योगों से देश सजाएँ,
आत्मनिर्भर भारत बनाएँ।
कौशल विकास से युवा बढ़ेंगे,
नए उद्योग और काम मिलेंगे।
गाँव-शहर सब साथ चलेंगे,
मेक इन इंडिया का सपना रचेंगे।
आओ मिलकर कदम बढ़ाएँ,
मेक इन इंडिया को सफल बनाएँ।
हर घर में गूँजे यही नारा,
मेक इन इंडिया, देश हमारा।"""
Tdj4cbV6T3w,Nicely documented 🔥
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"""Share of gdp is lower for manufacturing than it was in 2013-14"" that doesn't mean manufacturing didn't grow well. It's obvious to everybody it did in absolute terms. The service sector just grew much faster. The economy more than doubled in a decade, so manufacturing also doubled to stay the same %. 
Same thing when you talk about population percentage in manufacturing. India's working population has grown a lot in 10 years, it doesn't mean there aren't more people working in manufacturing today - there are, just that more people are working in other sectors - particularly because the major increase in working population came from agriculture-intense rural population due to higher birth rates. Same issue when you compare India's share in global exports, it depends too much on what happened in other countries. There are too many confounding factors in the data points you're cherrypicking. This is a strange and misleading lens to look at the state of the manufacturing sector in India today. If you were being accurate, you would have atleast shown the absolute numbers at some point which you chose not to."
Tdj4cbV6T3w,He looks like a more serious Rohan Joshi XD
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"😂😂
I hope you don't think that we're childrens!?

Come on seriously!"
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"India's service sector is literally too much overpowered for now. Like TCS is the global exporter of services while a US firm, wipro, infosys trail... Like come on"
Tdj4cbV6T3w,producing cow dung is quite enough for india
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"Not really where it was - but rather the same proportion of where it was. The GDP has doubled, which means manufacturing has doubled, and so have services and agriculture."
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"The best way to describe India, which I heard from a Chinese scholar in a TV program, is that India is one big pile of mud.  It is a very stable pile of mud.  It just needs to be ""managed"" so it does not turn the rest of the world an even bigger pile of mud.  That is the best outcome you can have about India."
Tdj4cbV6T3w,ok boss
Tdj4cbV6T3w,There is no make in India only assembling in India India is the world's LEGO hub.
Tdj4cbV6T3w,India has an ego too big for its skull.
Tdj4cbV6T3w,This is irrelevant. Just keeping pace with the economy shows that manufacturing isn't lagging. It doesn't mean the scheme failed. India tripled it's economy and so did manufacturing over this period. 300% growth over 10 years isn't a failure.
Tdj4cbV6T3w,Whatever manufacturing there was has been destroyed by this govt
Tdj4cbV6T3w,A total failure. India is just an assembly hub. A giant LEGO enterprise
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"Such a generic graph based analysis was not expected. I was hoping to get some information regarding the import substitutions that may or may not have taken place, products that we have to able to export which we were not able to do so earlier etc."
Tdj4cbV6T3w,India was never a leader just yes man to western white people
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"HAHAHAHH india is useless, may india never progress past the 3rd/4th world. they don't deserve it."
Tdj4cbV6T3w,india has the highest scammer to gdp ratio.
Tdj4cbV6T3w,India is Superpower in Telling Stories and doing Good debate. China is Superpower in Innovation and Development.
Tdj4cbV6T3w,Except tamil nadu not a single state did well in manufacturing
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"No wonder  ur analysis, given Shekhar Gupta's pencant fir Congress..I think we should give up on watching this biased channel!"
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"Bad headline and even worse analysis. The delta between 17 and 18 is not significant. It could be just cycles. If it had fallen from 22 to 17, yes India should be worried. India is going through a realignment of resources. And COVID hit manufacturing and infrastructure jobs the most. The rate should come back up. The real issue India faces is decreased consumption in the west due to aging and other factors. Exports cannot grow at the required pace anymore. India needs to figure out what new sectors will get it to 10%+ real growth overall on an average. India has missed the low cost export manufacturing bus and it cannot prosper from this segment. There is heavy competition now which China did not have when it rapidly grew between 2000 and 2010."
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"You can't increase your manufacturing by huge margin if your manufacturing industry mostly rely on Foreign investment. Your Smartphone production is increasing bcus foreign brands willingly use india as their manufacturing base. So I advise to maintain that stop being too hostile towards Chinese brands bcus they contribute more than apple and Samsung into the production output. If india becoming too hostile towards Chinese brands you aren't going to see production increase in other technology hardware like laptop, tablet, TVs, Monitor screen etc."
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"I think India businesses need land at discounted rates as long as wages are decent, no 
environmental problems. Take very little land cost in farflung areas. Support also with labour and tech wherever needed."
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"I think the privilege and potential population (  finance wise ) are venturing into business and entrepreneurship. So India will continue to see improvement . India has seen changes in space and defence already . Stock market is booming , students as young as 15-16 year old are trading and learning stock market .The educated people who own shares of farms and land find direction to run sales business or  production etc . But it will take alot i mean alot to become a superpower . Indian media and politicans are delusional."
Tdj4cbV6T3w,India should build toilet first before thinking about Make in India
Tdj4cbV6T3w,Endia cant run a country 😂😂😂.. Africa will rise before endia
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"Enhance defence research and development homegrown industry production

Self reliant space technology 
Heavy industries 
Electronics

Homegrown software and internet technology

Tdj4cbV6T3w,"The manufacturing push in India is just not working. Corruption and red tape are big hurdles. Tax and labour reforms are required.
Countries like Vietnam are way ahead of India."
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"After Swatch bharat, India still remains the dirtiest country"
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"I am predicting that 20 years later, this same guy will post a video to discuss 20 years later, why Make In India is still not working.  But But But, he will also say that in absolute terms, the Indian manufacturing is growing.  What he won't say is that the so-called manufacturing growth is just rising on the rise of the technological and social progress of humanity in the world.  

In another word, India will have a better life, in general, not because India itself but because humanity has been progressing.  This is actually the key objective of keep talking about Make In India, or GDP Growth or whatever.  Given time, progress will show.  But keep talking about it will prevent any potential social unrest, revolution or even break up of this new India nation.  Now you know the inside story of why India is so interested in TALKING BIG.  It is buying time.  Time will solve everything."
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"Chinese here.  Without labor reform, land reform and frankly speaking, social reform that China has gone through, there is NO WAY that India could achieve what China did.  It is NOT ABOUT the lacking of FDI.  It about that there is NO FERFILE SOIL for any FDI in India for manufacturing.  Any foreign investors will be SWALLOWED by local governments and local enterprises (which are controlled by the same people who controlled the local governments) through labor laws, land laws, water, electricity and worse of all, the retroactive tax laws.  

India, to use farming as example, is salted soil.  Nothing foreign will grow there.  Only the local plants could grow there.  Any foreign plants will be slaughtered by the locals in just several years for the fruits and dump the plants to rot.  It is the SOIL!  It is the LOCAL PRACTICE.  Without a revolution, without a massive social reform, NOTHING WILL CHANGE."
Tdj4cbV6T3w,We are the place where gods are given birth to. All the godd in the world comes from us. Today we can also give birth to other gods.
Tdj4cbV6T3w,Why most of new  billionaires in India are coming from Manufacturing sector
Tdj4cbV6T3w,hardly
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"Make In India' logo designed by foreign firm, says RTI 😂

Make in India fails to lift manufacturing share in GDP in 10 yrs
The share of value addition by manufacturing sector is 15.9% in 2023-24 compared to 16.7% of GDP (in constant price) in 2013-14."
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"Instead of showing  growth in absolute terms, you are showing growth per GDP 
Since india is world's fastest growing GDP it denominator is high so a 6% or 7% growth in production, if taken as a percentage of GDP(which grew 7-8%), will show a lower percentage 
This will give an impression  that there's a shrinkage of production. 
This not a correct way of analyzing"
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"Excellent compilation. Request you to keep the duration of your videos less than 7 minutes. Request  from a soul who does not watch any TV news for 10+ years. Thank you,"

Tdj4cbV6T3w,This is eye opening. Even though the non-biological vanar sena will make you believe otherwise. Thanks to TCA for telling the truth.
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"TCA Raghavan is misleading the viewers.  After all, from 26 May 2014 onwards, -India- Bharath has been the champion manufacturer of exaggerated self-glorification,  champion manufacturer of imagined cultural superiority,  and champion manufacturer of Hindu superstitiousness."
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"Manufacturing yield will come into reality in the 2030s. Land, labor, and farm reform could add another 2% boost to its GDP."
Tdj4cbV6T3w,"No power can stop india's economic progress, development, growth, stability, and prosperity. Atama nirbhar BHARAT. Good governance effective structural reform policies. Sabka saath Sabka vishvash sabka prayash sabka vikash"
Tdj4cbV6T3w,How much donations Mr Soros made?
Tdj4cbV6T3w,All thanks to Mogliji ! Our Manufacturing is soaring as fast as Hero cycle !
Tdj4cbV6T3w,Make in India is 90% import from China and assemble in India 😂😂😂
Tdj4cbV6T3w,Unlike services it takes a lot of time and effort to bootstrap.manufacturing. imagine the time it took for indian automobile industry to grow. But once done it is usually hard to stop.
Tdj4cbV6T3w,But had Make In India not happened we would have only software and service growth. So overall gdp would have less growth. MIA helped in some sense which was dropping as a %. Atleast it grew same rate as overall gdp which is a success

hurdpPzEKjI,Indian workers really do a lot of hardwork without the credit and benefit.
hurdpPzEKjI,B I 👌
hurdpPzEKjI,❤
hurdpPzEKjI,.31 cents per kilogram????? this is an abomination
hurdpPzEKjI,Anyone here from the Powerpoint placeholder youtube link? 😭
hurdpPzEKjI,"OMG! This totally brought me back to my childhood in the early 2000s! My dad had a beautiful wooden chess set, and I used to stare at the knights for HOURS, wondering how they were made.  Never knew it was SUCH a precise process.  This video is AMAZING!"
hurdpPzEKjI,"After watching this, it struck me how hardworking the less fortunate are"
hurdpPzEKjI,Moral of the story? We all like the smell of poop in small quantities 😆 🤣 😂
hurdpPzEKjI,OMG I'm s-s-sobbing rn 😭😭😭  This is absolutely breathtaking!  The craftsmanship... the dedication... I can't even!!!  The detail is INSANE!
hurdpPzEKjI,"OMG, I'm not crying, YOU'RE CRYING!  Those poor, tiny muga silkworms, working themselves to death for a $6,500 sari! But wait...the saffron farmers?  Crying again. The cardamom harvesters?  BRB, need more tissues.  This whole video is a TEARJERKER, but I need to know: are there any discounts on bulk Kleenex?"
hurdpPzEKjI,Indian businesses making the most expensive products? Guess I’ve been living on a budget! Time to start saving for that luxury item—who knew India was making such exclusive treasures? 💎💰😆
hurdpPzEKjI,"Wow, what an incredible journey through the exquisite craftsmanship and immense effort that goes into creating some of the world's most luxurious products! As I listened to the stories of artisans—from the meticulous carving of chess pieces, representing centuries of skill, to the delicate extraction of jasmine oil—my mind couldn't help but wander to my own experiences with handcrafted items; they always seem to carry a part of the creator with them."
hurdpPzEKjI,I thank all of the hard working folks in India who work tirelessly so that we can have expensive items/food.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  Seeing all of the hard work in the heat and sun..wow..
hurdpPzEKjI,"I know about this kind of agarwood, its price is so expensive"
hurdpPzEKjI,"Just for your information, the real saffron is the Iranian one, everyone in middle east know this fact, and thats why the Persian saffron sold multiple times more expensive than Indian one in Dubai, saudi, turkey, and the rest of the world."
hurdpPzEKjI,I am from Pakistan here we also used ghee my mom usually brought butter of desi cow from my grandparents and then she extract the ghee from it.
hurdpPzEKjI,Unientity provides chess pieces for the master chess associations. India provides for the prelims. Not the finals. We provide for the finals.
hurdpPzEKjI,That dress made from Muga silk is not a saree it’s called Mekhela Sador it’s a traditional dress that is worn by females in the indian state of Assam❤
hurdpPzEKjI,The people of India make more with little offered to please most make their life others life comfortable and happy.
hurdpPzEKjI,We also fox nut cultivation in Bihar and many workers work there. I see them work so hard.
hurdpPzEKjI,Saffron 😢 used to be business of kashmiri pandits thes Mfs snatched it
hurdpPzEKjI,"This is the best video I have watched in a long time. Thank you very, very much for showing"
hurdpPzEKjI,World is racist towards Indian but yet they need Indian made products. The irony.
hurdpPzEKjI,The sizes are defined by a westerners despite chess being an Indian game. Why can’t Indians define something on their own. Even yoga in India is being certified by western companies. Kuch to khud karo. Poori zindagi angrezon ki chaat‘te rahoge kya.
hurdpPzEKjI,Agar wood perfume and pat silk left to show from Assam
hurdpPzEKjI,14:50 Tahmil nahdoo 😂
hurdpPzEKjI,"Seeing these skilled craftsman, reminds me how the British colonialist DEINDUSTRIALISED INDIA. They smashed the factories, rendered cottage industries unviable due to high taxes and even maiming the artisans and craftsmen who have the talent passed on to them from generations. India dropped down having 24% share of world GDP to less than 4% in a span of 200 years. Never in its 7000 year history did it see such depredation. Britain not only  took around $61 trillion from India (as reported by Oxfam report) but it also crippled one of the richest civilisation and took all its treasures to the British museum."
hurdpPzEKjI,"All these item are very very expensive and not many of us can afford it, but I wonder how much these workers received in the chain of production of this luxurious item."
hurdpPzEKjI,Why are they still poor?
hurdpPzEKjI,"Indians are very hardworking people - complaining isn’t their philosophy, that’s why they can adapt and achieve great results. India Once a great civilisation who dominated world trade-Post colonial India is rising fast and strong all the best ❤"
hurdpPzEKjI,Notice how all the expensive businesses are reliant on the natural resources of this country not its man made or human resources.
hurdpPzEKjI,Just change the label to made in Italy then you can mark the price thousands time more. The amount craftsmen ship to make a chess board and set and the expensive one is just $500. But if it is made in same way in USA then it will be min $5000.
hurdpPzEKjI,Unique... 👍🙏
hurdpPzEKjI,Aloha hugs 🤗 Mahalo I saw the live Chest Tornament
hurdpPzEKjI,"I believe ancient India was one of the wealthiest empire ever, but unfortunately they got conquered by the British, India couldn't recover from that obviously seeing how poverty came in full force but somehow despite all that, they persevered, becoming one of the world's leading hands in mathematics and technology"
hurdpPzEKjI,guys everyone should try perfume from leearkk which is indian made and worth for money.i swear you won't regret😅.it will last upto 24 hrs pakkaaaa
hurdpPzEKjI,So damn good!
hurdpPzEKjI,"I’m truly happy to see such positive comments and appreciation for India. India is indeed a treasure—every time you explore it, you uncover something even more fascinating. Each state has its own unique culture, language, and heritage. Sadly, during British rule, so much of our wealth, charm, legacy, and distinctive art were taken from us. Even now, there are misconceptions about India—some call it a poor country, stereotype us with terms like ""curry,"" or express hatred towards Indians living abroad. Witnessing this bias is deeply hurtful.  

Thank you for making this video and shedding light on these talented craftsmen, who are unfortunately often underpaid. It means a lot."
hurdpPzEKjI,"Imagine the knight is missing one line on the neck, it will be end of the world 😂"
hurdpPzEKjI,I will never look at Makhana in the same way again. The amount of labour is something beyond I imagined. I knew it was tough..
hurdpPzEKjI,Are any of the toilets?
hurdpPzEKjI,"The pronunciation of PATAN is very wrong. It should be PAA-TA-N.....Please correct it. This is one of the most unique and iconic traditional legacy of Gujarati, India...."
