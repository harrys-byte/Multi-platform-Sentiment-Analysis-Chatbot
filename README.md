# Multi-platform-Sentiment-Analysis-Chatbot
This project combines scraping, sentiment classification, topic extraction, and  visualization into a unified pipeline for efficient analysis.

This project aims to develop a comprehensive sentiment analysis framework that: 
• Scrapes and collects data from platforms such as YouTube, Reddit, Medium, and Bing News. 

• Cleans and deduplicates the collected data to ensure only valid and unique articles/posts/comments are considered. 

• Applies both VADER (rule-based) and RoBERTa (transformer-based) models to perform sentiment analysis, offering users a comparative understanding of the results from different approaches. 

• Presents insights through visualizations like count plots and heatmaps to enhance interpretability. 

• Provides the user with an option to select the sentiment model based on their specific needs, through an intuitive interface.
